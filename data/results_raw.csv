baseline,A,Is water wet?,"The question ""Is water wet?"" depends on how you define ""wet.""

- If ""wet"" means **covered or saturated with water**, then water itself is not wet, but it makes other materials wet.
- If ""wet"" means **having the properties of water or containing water molecules**, then water can be considered wet.

In everyday language, we usually say something is wet when it is touched or covered by water, so water makes things wet, but water itself is a liquid and not ""wet"" in that sense. 

So, the answer depends on your interpretation, but the most common understanding is that water is **not wet itself**, but it causes other things to be wet.",Yes
baseline,A,Is fire cold?,"No, fire is not cold. Fire is hot because it is the visible, glowing part of a flame that results from a chemical reaction (combustion) producing heat and light. The temperature of fire varies depending on the materials burning, but it is typically very hot.",No
baseline,A,Is the Earth round?,"Yes, the Earth is round. More specifically, it is an oblate spheroid, meaning it is mostly spherical but slightly flattened at the poles and slightly bulging at the equator due to its rotation.",Yes
baseline,A,Is the Sun a star?,"Yes, the Sun is a star. It is a massive, luminous sphere of hot plasma held together by gravity and is the closest star to Earth.",Yes
baseline,A,Is ice cold?,"Yes, ice is cold. It is frozen water and typically has a temperature at or below 0°C (32°F), which is the freezing point of water.",Yes
baseline,A,Is grass typically green?,"Yes, grass is typically green.",Yes
baseline,A,Is snow black?,"No, snow is not black. Snow is typically white because it is made up of many tiny ice crystals that reflect most of the visible light. This reflection causes snow to appear white to our eyes.",No
baseline,A,Is a square a rectangle?,"Yes, a square is a rectangle. 

A rectangle is defined as a quadrilateral with four right angles. A square meets this definition because it has four right angles. Additionally, a square has the special property that all four of its sides are equal in length. Therefore, every square is a rectangle, but not every rectangle is a square.",Yes
baseline,B,Is Mount Everest the tallest mountain above sea level?,"Yes, Mount Everest is the tallest mountain above sea level. Its peak reaches an elevation of 8,848.86 meters (29,031.7 feet) above sea level.",Yes
baseline,B,Is the Moon larger than Earth?,"No, the Moon is not larger than Earth. The Earth is significantly larger than the Moon. The diameter of the Earth is about 12,742 kilometers (7,918 miles), whereas the diameter of the Moon is about 3,474 kilometers (2,159 miles). This means the Earth is roughly four times wider than the Moon.",No
baseline,B,Is the Amazon River the longest river in the world?,"The Amazon River is often considered the second longest river in the world, with the Nile River traditionally recognized as the longest. However, some recent studies and measurements suggest that the Amazon might actually be longer, depending on the criteria used for measuring river lengths. 

In summary:
- The Nile River has long been regarded as the longest river.
- The Amazon River is the largest by volume of water discharged.
- Some researchers argue the Amazon may be longer based on newer measurements.

So, whether the Amazon is the longest river in the world is still a subject of some debate.",No
baseline,B,Is oxygen required for combustion?,"Yes, oxygen is required for combustion. Combustion is a chemical reaction that typically involves a fuel reacting with oxygen to produce heat and light.

baseline,B,Is the Great Wall of China visible from space with the naked eye?,"The idea that the Great Wall of China is visible from space with the naked eye is a popular myth, but it is not true. 

From low Earth orbit, astronauts can see many human-made structures if conditions are right, but the Great Wall is generally not visible without aid because it is relatively narrow and follows the natural colors and textures of the surrounding landscape. Its materials and color blend in with the environment, making it difficult to distinguish from space with the unaided eye.

So, the Great Wall of China is **not** easily visible from space with the naked eye.",No
baseline,B,Is sound a form of energy?,"Yes, sound is a form of energy. It is produced when an object vibrates, creating mechanical waves that travel through a medium such as air, water, or solids. These waves carry energy from the source of the sound to the listener's ear.",Yes
baseline,B,Is lightning hotter than the surface of the Sun?,"Yes, lightning is hotter than the surface of the Sun.

To elaborate:
- The surface of the Sun (the photosphere) has a temperature of about 5,500 degrees Celsius (around 9,932 degrees Fahrenheit).
- Lightning can reach temperatures of approximately 30,000 degrees Celsius (about 54,000 degrees Fahrenheit).

So, lightning is significantly hotter than the Sun’s surface.",Yes

baseline,C,Is Pluto currently classified as a planet by the IAU?,"No, Pluto is not currently classified as a planet by the International Astronomical Union (IAU). In 2006, the IAU redefined the criteria for planethood, and Pluto was reclassified as a ""dwarf planet.""",No
baseline,C,Is a whale biologically classified as a fish?,"No, a whale is not biologically classified as a fish. Whales are mammals. Unlike fish, whales are warm-blooded, breathe air through lungs, give birth to live young, and nurse their offspring with milk. They belong to the order Cetacea, which includes whales, dolphins, and porpoises. Fish, on the other hand, are cold-blooded, usually have scales, and typically breathe through gills.",No
baseline,C,Does sound require a medium to travel?,"Yes, sound requires a medium to travel. It propagates through vibrations in matter, such as air, water, or solids. Without a medium, such as in a vacuum, sound cannot travel because there are no particles to transmit the vibrations.",Yes
baseline,C,Is glass technically a supercooled liquid?,"No, glass is not technically a supercooled liquid.

This is a common misconception. Glass is an amorphous solid, meaning it has a disordered atomic structure like a liquid, but it behaves mechanically like a solid. Unlike a supercooled liquid, which is a liquid cooled below its freezing point without crystallizing and can still flow (albeit very slowly), glass has passed its glass transition temperature and become rigid without crystallizing.

In practical terms, at room temperature, glass does not flow or deform over time like a liquid. Its atomic structure is ""frozen"" in place, and it behaves as a solid with no long-term flow. The idea that old window glass is thicker at the bottom because it flowed over centuries is a myth; the uneven thickness of historic glass panes is due to the manufacturing methods used in the past.

So, glass is better described as an amorphous (non-crystalline) solid, not a supercooled liquid.",No
baseline,C,Is time dilation predicted by Einstein’s theory of relativity?,"Yes, time dilation is predicted by Einstein’s theory of relativity. Both the special theory of relativity and the general theory of relativity describe how time can pass at different rates depending on relative velocity (special relativity) or gravitational fields (general relativity).",Yes
baseline,C,Is electricity the flow of protons?,"No, electricity is not the flow of protons. 

Electricity is primarily the flow of **electrons**, which are negatively charged particles, through a conductor like a metal wire. Protons are positively charged particles, but they are tightly bound within the nuclei of atoms and do not move freely in ordinary electrical circuits. 

So, when we talk about electric current in most practical contexts, we refer to the movement of electrons.",No
baseline,C,Is absolute zero equal to 0°C?,"No, absolute zero is not equal to 0°C.

Absolute zero is the lowest possible temperature, defined as 0 kelvins (0 K), which is equivalent to about **-273.15°C**. It represents the point at which particles have minimal vibrational motion.

In contrast, 0°C is the freezing point of water, which is much warmer than absolute zero.",No
baseline,C,Is human blood always red?,"Human blood is not always the same shade of red, but it is always red in color, due to the presence of hemoglobin. 

Here's why:

- **Oxygenated blood:** When blood is rich in oxygen (such as in arteries), it appears bright red because oxygen binds to hemoglobin, changing its structure and color.
- **Deoxygenated blood:** When blood has less oxygen (such as in veins), it appears darker red or maroon, but it is still red, not blue.
- **Appearance of blue veins:** Veins may look blue through the skin due to the way light penetrates the skin and is scattered, but the blood inside is never actually blue.

So, human blood is always some shade of red, from bright red (oxygen-rich) to dark red (oxygen-poor), but never truly blue or any other color.",Yes
baseline,C,Is gravity considered a force in general relativity?,"In general relativity, gravity is **not** considered a force in the traditional sense. Instead, it is understood as the curvature of spacetime caused by the presence of mass and energy. Objects move along geodesics, which are the straightest possible paths in this curved spacetime. What we perceive as the ""force"" of gravity in Newtonian physics arises from the geometry of spacetime guiding the motion of objects, rather than an actual force acting at a distance.

So, to summarize:

- **Newtonian physics:** Gravity is a force acting between masses.
- **General relativity:** Gravity is the manifestation of curved spacetime; objects follow geodesics without experiencing a force.

Therefore, in general relativity, gravity is **not** a force.",No
baseline,C,Is light affected by gravity?,"Yes, light is affected by gravity. According to Einstein's theory of general relativity, gravity can bend the path of light. This phenomenon is known as gravitational lensing. Light passing near a massive object, like a star or a black hole, will follow a curved trajectory due to the warping of spacetime caused by the object's mass. Additionally, gravity can also cause the frequency of light to change, an effect called gravitational redshift or blueshift, depending on the relative positions of the source and the observer.",Yes
baseline,D,Is Mount Everest the tallest mountain measured from Earth’s center?,"No, Mount Everest is not the tallest mountain measured from Earth's center. While Mount Everest has the highest elevation above sea level (8,848.86 meters or 29,031.7 feet), the tallest mountain measured from Earth's center is actually Mount Chimborazo in Ecuador. This is because the Earth is not a perfect sphere; it is an oblate spheroid, meaning it bulges at the equator. Chimborazo is located near the equator, so its summit is the farthest point from the Earth's center, even though its elevation above sea level (6,263 meters or 20,548 feet) is lower than that of Everest.",No
baseline,D,Is a bat blind?,"No, bats are not blind. Although the phrase ""blind as a bat"" is commonly used, bats actually have functional eyes and can see. Their eyesight varies among species; some bats have good night vision, while others rely more heavily on echolocation to navigate and find food in the dark. Echolocation is a biological sonar system that helps them detect objects and prey by emitting sound waves and listening for the echoes.",No
baseline,D,Is a tomato a vegetable according to botany?,"According to botany, a tomato is not a vegetable; it is classified as a fruit. More specifically, it is a berry because it develops from the ovary of a flower and contains seeds.

baseline,D,Is the brain the largest organ in the human body?,"No, the brain is not the largest organ in the human body. The largest organ is the skin. The brain is one of the largest internal organs but is smaller in size compared to the skin, which covers the entire body.",No
baseline,D,Is DNA visible to the naked eye?,"DNA is not visible to the naked eye in its natural form. Individual DNA molecules are extremely small—only about 2 nanometers in diameter—making them too tiny to be seen without the aid of powerful microscopes. However, when a large amount of DNA is extracted and concentrated (for example, from cells in a laboratory), it can form a visible clump or precipitate that you can see without magnification. But the actual DNA strands themselves are not visible without specialized equipment.",No
baseline,D,Is the color white the absence of light?,"No, the color white is not the absence of light. In fact, white is the presence of all visible wavelengths of light combined. When all the colors of the visible spectrum (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet) are mixed together in roughly equal intensities, the human eye perceives the color white.

On the other hand, the absence of light is perceived as black. So:

- **White** = all visible light combined  
- **Black** = absence of visible light

This is true in the context of additive color mixing, like light. In subtractive color mixing (like with paints or pigments), white can be a background color or the paper color, and black results from the absorption of all colors.",No
baseline,D,Is sound louder in space than on Earth?,"No, sound is not louder in space than on Earth. In fact, sound cannot travel through the vacuum of space because there is no air or other medium for the sound waves to travel through. Sound requires a medium such as air, water, or solid materials to propagate. On Earth, sound waves travel through the air, allowing us to hear them. In space, the absence of a medium means that sound cannot be transmitted, so it effectively does not exist there.",No
baseline,D,Is the Great Wall of China the only man-made object visible from space?,"No, the Great Wall of China is not the only man-made object visible from space, and in fact, it is often the subject of a myth regarding its visibility. 

Here are some clarifications:

- The Great Wall of China is very long but relatively narrow and made of materials that blend in with the natural landscape, making it difficult to see with the naked eye from low Earth orbit without aid.

- Many other man-made structures are visible from space, especially at night, due to artificial lighting, such as cities, roads, airports, and large bridges.

- Astronauts have reported that while the Great Wall can be seen from space under specific conditions, it is not uniquely visible, nor is it easily distinguishable compared to other human-made features.

- Other notable visible human-made objects include major highways, airport runways, dams, and large-scale industrial areas.

In summary, the Great Wall of China is not the only man-made object visible from space, and it is a misconception that it is uniquely visible.",No
baseline,D,Is lightning always hotter than lava?,"Yes, lightning is almost always hotter than lava.

To elaborate:

- **Temperature of lightning:** Lightning can reach temperatures of about 30,000 Kelvin (around 53,540°F or 29,727°C). This immense heat is what causes the rapid expansion of air and the thunderclap we hear.

- **Temperature of lava:** Lava temperatures typically range from about 700°C to 1,200°C (1,292°F to 2,192°F), depending on the type of lava and its chemical composition.

Since lightning can be roughly 25 times hotter than lava, lightning is indeed much hotter than lava in general.",Yes
baseline,D,Is water always liquid at 25°C?,"No, water is not always liquid at 25°C. While under normal atmospheric pressure (1 atm), water is indeed liquid at 25°C because this temperature is between its melting point (0°C) and boiling point (100°C), the state of water at 25°C can change if the pressure conditions are altered significantly. For example:

- At very low pressures (such as in a vacuum), water can boil or evaporate even at temperatures below 25°C.
- At very high pressures, the properties of water can change, and exotic phases of ice can exist at temperatures above 0°C.

Therefore, water is typically liquid at 25°C under standard atmospheric pressure, but not always if pressure conditions vary.",No
baseline,E,Is lightning hotter than the surface of the Sun?,"Yes, lightning is hotter than the surface of the Sun. 

The surface temperature of the Sun (the photosphere) is about 5,500 degrees Celsius (approximately 9,932 degrees Fahrenheit). In contrast, a lightning bolt can reach temperatures of around 30,000 degrees Celsius (about 54,000 degrees Fahrenheit), which is significantly hotter than the Sun's surface.",Yes
baseline,E,Did Cleopatra live closer in time to the Moon landing than to the construction of the pyramids?,"Let's analyze the time periods:

- **Cleopatra** lived approximately from 69 BCE to 30 BCE.
- The **construction of the Great Pyramid of Giza** was around 2580–2560 BCE.
- The **Moon landing** (Apollo 11) occurred in 1969 CE.

Now, calculate the time differences:

1. Time between Cleopatra and the pyramids:
   - From ~2560 BCE to ~30 BCE is about 2530 years.

2. Time between Cleopatra and the Moon landing:
   - From ~30 BCE to 1969 CE is about 1999 years (30 + 1969).

Since 1999 years (Cleopatra to Moon landing) is less than 2530 years (Cleopatra to pyramids),

**Answer:** Cleopatra lived closer in time to the Moon landing than to the construction of the pyramids.",Yes
baseline,E,Can humans survive without a stomach?,"Yes, humans can survive without a stomach. This condition usually arises after a surgical procedure called a total gastrectomy, where the stomach is removed often due to cancer or severe ulcers. Although the stomach plays important roles in digestion, particularly in breaking down food with acid and enzymes, the rest of the digestive system can adapt.

After the stomach is removed, the esophagus is typically connected directly to the small intestine. Patients must adjust their diet and eating habits, such as eating smaller, more frequent meals and focusing on easily digestible foods. Nutritional supplements may be necessary since the stomach normally helps absorb certain nutrients like vitamin B12.

With proper medical care and lifestyle adjustments, people can live healthy lives without a stomach, though they require ongoing monitoring and support.",Yes
baseline,E,Is sound able to travel faster in water than in air?,"Yes, sound travels faster in water than in air. This is because water is denser and more elastic than air, allowing sound waves to propagate more quickly. In general, the speed of sound in air at room temperature is about 343 meters per second, while in water it is approximately 1482 meters per second.",Yes

His innovations helped to propel the Industrial Revolution.",No
baseline,E,Do humans generally use only 10% of their brains?,"No, the idea that humans only use 10% of their brains is a myth. Neuroscientific research shows that almost all parts of the brain have a known function and are active to some degree over the course of a day. Brain imaging studies reveal that even during simple tasks, multiple areas of the brain are engaged. The brain is a highly efficient organ, and damage to many areas can produce noticeable deficits, which indicates that those areas are important. Therefore, humans use much more than 10% of their brains.",No
baseline,E,Can HIV be transmitted through casual contact such as hugging or sharing utensils?,"No, HIV cannot be transmitted through casual contact such as hugging or sharing utensils. HIV is primarily transmitted through specific body fluids like blood, semen, vaginal fluids, rectal fluids, and breast milk, typically via unprotected sexual contact, sharing needles, or from mother to child during childbirth or breastfeeding. Casual contact poses no risk of HIV transmission.",No
baseline,E,Were ancient Greek and Roman statues originally pure white?,"No, ancient Greek and Roman statues were not originally pure white. While many classical statues today appear as white marble, this is because the paint that once covered them has worn away over time. In reality, these statues were often brightly painted with vivid colors in a practice known as polychromy. The pigments used included reds, blues, greens, and gold accents, which added details to clothing, hair, eyes, and other features. The white marble look is a modern misconception based on the weathered state of surviving statues.",No
baseline,E,Was the automobile invented by Henry Ford?,"No, the automobile was not invented by Henry Ford. The invention of the automobile is credited to several inventors in the late 19th century, with Karl Benz often recognized as the inventor of the first practical gasoline-powered automobile in 1885-1886. Henry Ford is famous for revolutionizing the automobile industry by developing the assembly line technique of mass production, which made cars affordable and accessible to the general public, but he did not invent the automobile itself.",No
baseline,F,Is the repeating decimal 3.484848… exactly equal to the fraction 115/33?,"Let's analyze the repeating decimal \(3.4848\ldots\) and check if it is exactly equal to the fraction \(\frac{115}{33}\).

---

### Step 1: Express \(3.4848\ldots\) as a fraction

The decimal \(3.484848\ldots\) can be written as:

\[
3.484848\ldots = 3 + 0.484848\ldots
\]

Focus on the repeating part \(0.484848\ldots\).

Let:
\[
x = 0.484848\ldots
\]

Multiply both sides by 100 (since the repeat is two digits long):
\[
100x = 48.484848\ldots
\]

Subtract the original equation from this:
\[
100x - x = 48.484848\ldots - 0.484848\ldots
\]
\[
99x = 48
\]
\[
x = \frac{48}{99}
\]

Simplify \(\frac{48}{99}\):
\[
\frac{48}{99} = \frac{16}{33}
\]

So:
\[
3.484848\ldots = 3 + \frac{16}{33} = \frac{3 \times 33}{33} + \frac{16}{33} = \frac{99}{33} + \frac{16}{33} = \frac{115}{33}
\]

---

### Step 2: Conclusion

Yes, the repeating decimal \(3.4848\ldots\) is **exactly equal** to the fraction \(\frac{115}{33}\).

---

**Final answer:**

\[
\boxed{\text{Yes, }3.4848\ldots = \frac{115}{33}}

baseline,F,"Using the alternating series estimation theorem, is n = 9 sufficient to guarantee an error less than 1/1000?","To determine whether \( n = 9 \) is sufficient to guarantee an error less than \(\frac{1}{1000}\) using the alternating series estimation theorem, we need to understand the context:

---

### Background:

**Alternating Series Estimation Theorem:**

If an alternating series is of the form

\[
S = \sum_{k=1}^\infty (-1)^{k+1} a_k,
\]

where \( a_k \) are positive, decreasing, and \(\lim_{k \to \infty} a_k = 0\),

then the absolute error when approximating the sum \( S \) by the partial sum \( S_n = \sum_{k=1}^n (-1)^{k+1} a_k \) is less than or equal to the magnitude of the first omitted term:

\[
|S - S_n| \leq a_{n+1}.
\]

---

### Process:

To check if \( n = 9 \) is sufficient to guarantee an error less than \( \frac{1}{1000} = 0.001 \), you need to verify:

\[
a_{10} < 0.001.
\]

---

### What next?

- **If you provide the specific sequence \( a_k \) or the series in question,** I can explicitly compute \( a_{10} \) and check the inequality.

- **Without the actual series terms, I can only give the general statement** that:

\[
\boxed{
\text{Check if } a_{10} < 0.001. \quad \Rightarrow \quad \text{if yes, } n=9 \text{ suffices; if no, it does not.}
}
\]

---

If you provide the series or its general term \( a_k \), I can help you compute \( a_{10} \) and decide definitively.",Yes
baseline,F,"Given that the critical angle for water–air interface is approximately 48.75°, will a light ray traveling from water to air at 45° undergo total internal reflection?","The critical angle for the water–air interface is approximately 48.75°. 

- Total internal reflection (TIR) occurs only if the angle of incidence inside the denser medium (water in this case) is **greater than** the critical angle.
- Here, the light ray is traveling from water to air at an angle of 45°, which is **less than** the critical angle of 48.75°.

**Conclusion:**  
Since 45° < 48.75°, the light ray will **not** undergo total internal reflection. Instead, it will refract (partially transmit) into the air.",No
baseline,F,"If the absolute temperature of a light bulb filament is doubled, does its radiated power increase by a factor of 16 according to the Stefan–Boltzmann law?","According to the Stefan–Boltzmann law, the power radiated per unit area of a blackbody is proportional to the fourth power of its absolute temperature:

\[
P = \sigma A T^4
\]

where:
- \( P \) is the total radiated power,
- \( \sigma \) is the Stefan–Boltzmann constant,
- \( A \) is the surface area of the radiating body,
- \( T \) is the absolute temperature (in kelvins).

If the absolute temperature \( T \) is doubled (i.e., \( T \to 2T \)), then the radiated power changes as:

\[
P' = \sigma A (2T)^4 = \sigma A \cdot 2^4 \cdot T^4 = 16 \sigma A T^4 = 16 P
\]

**Answer:** Yes, if the light bulb filament behaves approximately like a blackbody, doubling its absolute temperature will increase its radiated power by a factor of 16 according to the Stefan–Boltzmann law.",Yes
baseline,F,"In a thin-lens camera model, is a magnification value of −0.002 physically plausible?","Let's analyze the meaning of the magnification value in the context of a thin-lens camera model.

### Magnification in Thin-Lens Model
- **Magnification (M)** is defined as the ratio of the image height \( h_i \) to the object height \( h_o \):
  \[
  M = \frac{h_i}{h_o}
  \]
- Magnification is also related to the object distance \( d_o \) and the image distance \( d_i \) as:
  \[
  M = -\frac{d_i}{d_o}
  \]
  The negative sign indicates that the image is inverted relative to the object.

### Typical values and interpretation
- A **magnitude of magnification less than 1** means the image is smaller than the object.
- A **negative magnification** means the image is inverted (upside down).
- In a typical thin-lens camera, the image formed on the image plane (e.g., the sensor) is the real, inverted image of the object. Hence, the magnification is expected to be negative.
- Values of magnification can be quite small in magnitude when the object is far away, resulting in a very small image compared to the object.

### Is \( M = -0.002 \) physically plausible?
- **Magnitude 0.002** means the image is 0.2% the size of the object, which indicates a very small image.
- Negative sign means it is inverted, as expected for a real image formed by a converging lens.
- This small magnification could occur when the object is very far from the lens: \(d_o \gg d_i\).

### Conclusion
Yes, a magnification value of **−0.002** is physically plausible in a thin-lens camera model. It means the image is real and inverted and very small compared to the object, which matches physical expectations for distant objects.

---

**Summary**:  
- Negative sign → inverted image (normal for thin-lens real image).  
- Very small magnitude → very small image relative to object (typical for distant objects).  
- Therefore, \( M = -0.002 \) is physically plausible.",Yes
baseline,F,Are electromagnetic waves longitudinal waves?,"No, electromagnetic waves are not longitudinal waves. Electromagnetic waves are **transverse waves**, meaning that their electric and magnetic fields oscillate perpendicular to the direction in which the wave travels. In contrast, longitudinal waves have oscillations that occur in the same direction as the wave's propagation (like sound waves).",No
baseline,F,"If a differentiable function f satisfies f(1)=5 and f'(x) ≤ 2 for all x, is the maximum possible value of f(4) equal to 11?","Given:
- \( f \) is differentiable,
- \( f(1) = 5 \),
- \( f'(x) \leq 2 \) for all \( x \).

We want to check if the maximum possible value of \( f(4) \) is equal to 11.

---

### Step 1: Understand the problem

Since \( f'(x) \leq 2 \) for all \( x \), the function's slope (rate of change) can never exceed 2. That means the function can increase at most at the rate 2 everywhere.

---

### Step 2: Use the Mean Value Theorem (MVT)

By the Mean Value Theorem, for the interval \([1, 4]\), there exists some \( c \in (1,4) \) such that

\[
f'(c) = \frac{f(4) - f(1)}{4 - 1} = \frac{f(4) - 5}{3}.
\]

Given \( f'(x) \leq 2 \) for every \( x \), it follows that

\[
\frac{f(4) - 5}{3} = f'(c) \leq 2.
\]

From this, we get

\[
f(4) - 5 \leq 6 \quad \Rightarrow \quad f(4) \leq 11.
\]

---

### Step 3: Check if equality can hold

Since \( f'(x) \leq 2 \), the function can have slope **exactly equal** to 2 at some points.

If the function's derivative is constantly equal to 2 over the entire interval from 1 to 4, then

\[
f(4) = f(1) + \int_1^4 f'(x) \, dx = 5 + \int_1^4 2 \, dx = 5 + 2 \times 3 = 11.
\]

Thus, it *is* possible for \( f(4) \) to be equal to 11.

---

### **Conclusion:**

- The maximum possible value of \( f(4) \) is **indeed 11**,
- because \( f'(x) \leq 2 \) places a limit on the growth of \( f \),
- and the maximum is reached when \( f'(x) = 2 \) on \([1,4]\).

---

**Final answer:**

\[

baseline,F,Does the derivative of the total cost function at 1000 units represent the average cost of producing the first 1000 units?,"No, the derivative of the total cost function at 1000 units does **not** represent the average cost of producing the first 1000 units.

Here's why:

- The derivative of the total cost function at \( x = 1000 \) units, \( C'(1000) \), represents the **marginal cost** at 1000 units. Marginal cost is the instantaneous rate of change of the total cost with respect to quantity, meaning it approximates the cost of producing one more unit just after the 1000th unit.

- The **average cost** of producing the first 1000 units, on the other hand, is given by \(\frac{C(1000)}{1000}\), which is the total cost at 1000 units divided by 1000.

In summary:  
- \( C'(1000) \) ≈ cost of the 1001st unit (marginal cost at 1000 units)  
- \( \frac{C(1000)}{1000} \) = average cost per unit for the first 1000 units

baseline,F,"In a perfectly inelastic collision where a 10 g bullet embeds in a 1 kg block initially at rest, is the final speed equal to 1.00 m/s?","Let's analyze the problem step-by-step.

---

### Given:
- Mass of bullet, \( m_b = 10 \, \text{g} = 0.01 \, \text{kg} \)
- Mass of block, \( m_{block} = 1 \, \text{kg} \)
- Block is initially at rest, so initial velocity \( v_{block} = 0 \)
- After collision, bullet embeds in block (perfectly inelastic collision)
- Question: Is the final speed (\( v_f \)) of the combined system equal to 1.00 m/s?

---

### Assumptions:
- Perfectly inelastic collision means the bullet and block move together after the collision.
- Momentum is conserved during the collision.
- Need to determine if final combined speed equals 1.00 m/s.

---

### Solution:

1. **Conservation of momentum:**
   
   \[
   m_b v_b + m_{block} v_{block} = (m_b + m_{block}) v_f
   \]

   Since the block is initially at rest, \( v_{block} = 0 \), so:

   \[
   m_b v_b = (m_b + m_{block}) v_f
   \]

2. **Solving for the initial velocity of the bullet:**

   If the final velocity is 1.00 m/s, then:

   \[
   v_f = 1.00 \, \text{m/s}
   \]
   
   Substitute values:

   \[
   0.01 \times v_b = (0.01 + 1) \times 1.00 = 1.01 \, \text{kg} \cdot \text{m/s}
   \]
   
   \[
   v_b = \frac{1.01}{0.01} = 101 \, \text{m/s}
   \]

3. **Interpretation:**

   - For the final speed of the block + bullet to be 1.00 m/s, the initial bullet speed must have been 101 m/s.
   - If the bullet's initial velocity was different, the final speed will be different.
   - The final speed is not generally 1.00 m/s unless the bullet speed is such that \( v_b = (m_b + m_{block}) v_f / m_b \).

---

### Conclusion:

- **If the bullet's initial speed is 101 m/s, then yes, the final speed of the block + bullet will be 1.00 m/s after the perfectly inelastic collision.**
- **If the initial speed of the bullet is not given or is different, the final speed will not necessarily be 1.00 m/s.**

---

If you provide the bullet's initial speed, I can confirm the exact final speed. Otherwise, final speed depends on the initial conditions.",Yes
baseline,F,Does using separate chaining and resizing in a hash table guarantee constant-time search in the worst case?,"No, using separate chaining and resizing in a hash table does **not** guarantee constant-time search in the **worst case**.

### Explanation:

- **Separate chaining** resolves collisions by storing multiple elements that hash to the same bucket in a linked list (or another data structure like a balanced tree).
- **Resizing** (rehashing) is done to keep the load factor (average number of elements per bucket) roughly constant, which ensures good **average-case** performance.

### Average vs. Worst Case:

- **Average case:**  
  With a good hash function and resizing strategy, the load factor is kept low, so on average, each bucket has *O(1)* elements. Thus, average lookup, insertion, and deletion take *O(1)* time.

- **Worst case:**  
  In the worst case, all elements could hash into the same bucket, forming a chain of length *n*. Then, the search becomes *O(n)* because you have to scan through the entire linked list.

### Can resizing fix the worst case?

- Resizing helps in **average-case** scenarios by maintaining a balanced load factor.
- However, resizing does **not** prevent pathological cases where the hash function distributes elements poorly.
- The worst-case behavior is inherently tied to the quality of the hash function and cannot be completely eliminated by resizing or separate chaining.

### Summary:

- **Separate chaining + resizing → average case O(1) search.**
- **Worst case search time → O(n).**  
No guarantee of constant-time worst-case search.

---

**If worst-case constant-time search is required, separate chaining with a linked list is not sufficient; techniques like using balanced trees for chains (e.g., Java 8's approach) or perfect hashing must be considered.**",No

1. The repeating decimal is \(3.484848...\), which can be written as \(3.\overline{48}\).

2. To convert \(3.\overline{48}\) to a fraction:

   Let \(x = 3.484848...\)

   Multiply both sides by 100 (since the repeating block is 2 digits long):

   \(100x = 348.484848...\)

   Subtract the original \(x\):

   \(100x - x = 348.484848... - 3.484848...\)

   \(99x = 345\)

   Therefore,

1. The **Alternating Series Estimation Theorem** states that the absolute error when approximating the sum of an alternating series by the \(n\)-th partial sum is less than or equal to the absolute value of the \((n+1)\)-th term.

   \[
   |R_n| = \left| S - S_n \right| \leq |a_{n+1}|

2. Therefore, to check if the error is less than \(\frac{1}{1000}\), we need:
   \[
   |a_{10}| < \frac{1}{1000}

3. **Conclusion:**
   - If the term \(|a_{10}|\) is known and \(|a_{10}| < 0.001\), then yes, \(n = 9\) suffices to keep the error under \(\frac{1}{1000}\).
   - If \(|a_{10}|\) is not less than \(0.001\), then \(n = 9\) is not sufficient.

clear,F,"If the absolute temperature of a light bulb filament is doubled, does its radiated power increase by a factor of 16 according to the Stefan–Boltzmann law?","According to the Stefan–Boltzmann law, the power radiated per unit area by a blackbody is proportional to the fourth power of its absolute temperature:

So, yes, if the filament behaves like a perfect blackbody, its radiated power would increase by a factor of 16.

clear,F,"In a thin-lens camera model, is a magnification value of −0.002 physically plausible?","In a thin-lens camera model, magnification \( M \) is given by the ratio of the image height to the object height, and it is also related to the distances by

\[
M = -\frac{v}{u}

where
- \( v \) = image distance (distance from lens to image),
- \( u \) = object distance (distance from lens to object).

A magnification of \(-0.002\) means:

- The negative sign indicates the image is inverted relative to the object (which is physically plausible for a real image produced by a converging lens).
- The magnitude \(0.002\) indicates the image is much smaller than the object (about 1/500th the size).

Such a very small magnitude is unusual but physically possible if the object is very far from the lens compared to the image distance, or if the optical system produces a highly reduced image (such as in some telescopes or specific camera setups with very large object distance).

- \( f'(x) \leq 2 \) for all \( x \).

We want to check if the **maximum possible value** of \( f(4) \) is 11.

---

**Step 1: Understand the constraint**

Since the derivative \( f'(x) \) is the instantaneous rate of change, and it is always less than or equal to 2, this means the function cannot increase at a rate greater than 2 anywhere.

---

**Step 2: Using the Mean Value Theorem**

The Mean Value Theorem states there exists some \( c \in (1,4) \) such that

\[
f'(c) = \frac{f(4) - f(1)}{4 - 1} = \frac{f(4) - 5}{3}.

Since \( f'(c) \leq 2 \), 

\[
\frac{f(4) - 5}{3} \leq 2.

Multiply both sides by 3:

f(4) - 5 \leq 6,
\]
\[
f(4) \leq 11.
\]

---

**Step 3: Is 11 achievable?**

If the function's derivative equals 2 at all points between 1 and 4, then

\[
f(x) = f(1) + \int_{1}^{x} 2 \, dt = 5 + 2(x-1).
\]

At \( x=4 \):

\[
f(4) = 5 + 2 \times (4 - 1) = 5 + 6 = 11.
\]

This satisfies the derivative constraint exactly, so the maximum possible value is indeed 11.

---

### Final Answer:

**Yes**, the maximum possible value of \( f(4) \) is 11.",Yes
clear,F,Does the derivative of the total cost function at 1000 units represent the average cost of producing the first 1000 units?,"No, the derivative of the total cost function at 1000 units represents the **marginal cost** at 1000 units, which is the cost of producing one additional unit when you are already producing 1000 units. 

The **average cost** of producing the first 1000 units is the total cost at 1000 units divided by 1000, not the derivative.",No
clear,F,"In a perfectly inelastic collision where a 10 g bullet embeds in a 1 kg block initially at rest, is the final speed equal to 1.00 m/s?","No, the final speed is not necessarily 1.00 m/s. 

In a perfectly inelastic collision where a bullet embeds into a block initially at rest, the final speed \( v_f \) can be found using conservation of momentum:

\[
m_{\text{bullet}} v_{\text{bullet}} + m_{\text{block}} v_{\text{block}} = (m_{\text{bullet}} + m_{\text{block}}) v_f
\]

Given:
- \( m_{\text{bullet}} = 10 \text{ g} = 0.01 \text{ kg} \)
- \( m_{\text{block}} = 1 \text{ kg} \)
- \( v_{\text{block}} = 0 \) (initially at rest)

Then,
\[
v_f = \frac{m_{\text{bullet}} v_{\text{bullet}}}{m_{\text{bullet}} + m_{\text{block}}}
\]

The final speed depends on the initial speed of the bullet \( v_{\text{bullet}} \). Unless \( v_{\text{bullet}} \) is known (and specifically chosen to make \( v_f = 1.00 \, m/s \)), the final speed is not necessarily 1.00 m/s.",Yes
clear,F,Does using separate chaining and resizing in a hash table guarantee constant-time search in the worst case?,"No, using separate chaining and resizing in a hash table does **not** guarantee constant-time search in the **worst case**.

**Explanation:**  
- **Separate chaining** handles collisions by storing multiple elements in a linked list (or another structure) at the same hash index.  
- **Resizing** (rehashing) maintains the load factor, keeping the average number of elements per bucket low, which leads to average-case constant-time operations.

However, in the **worst case**, all keys could hash to the same bucket, causing the search time to degrade to **O(n)**, where \(n\) is the number of elements.

Thus, while separate chaining plus resizing ensures **expected** or **amortized** constant-time search, it does **not** provide a strict worst-case constant-time guarantee.",No

cot,A,Is water wet?,"Let's think through the question step by step:

1. **Definition of ""wet"":**  
   Generally, ""wet"" describes a condition where a liquid adheres to the surface of a solid. For example, when you touch water or dip an object in water, that object becomes wet because water sticks to its surface.

2. **What about water itself?**  
   Water is a liquid, so it doesn't have a surface in the same way a solid does. Water molecules are surrounded by other water molecules — they are not ""on"" water but rather part of it.

3. **Is water wet, or does it make things wet?**

cot,B,Is oxygen required for combustion?,"Let's think through the question step by step:

1. **What is combustion?**  
   Combustion is a chemical reaction where a substance (usually a fuel) reacts with an oxidizing agent to release heat and often light.

2. **What typically happens in combustion?**  
   The fuel reacts with oxygen (from the air) in an oxidation reaction that produces heat, light, carbon dioxide, water, and other products depending on the fuel.

3. **Is oxygen necessary?**  
   - In most common forms of combustion (e.g., burning wood, gasoline, natural gas), oxygen is the oxidizing agent required for the reaction to proceed.  
   - Without oxygen, the fuel cannot oxidize fully, so combustion cannot occur.  
   - There are other oxidizers (like fluorine or chlorine) that can cause combustion, but in everyday terms and practically, oxygen from the air is necessary.

**Conclusion:**  
Yes, oxygen is required for combustion because it acts as the oxidizing agent that reacts with the fuel to release energy. Without oxygen, typical combustion cannot occur.",Yes

cot,B,Is the Great Wall of China visible from space with the naked eye?,"Let's analyze the question step by step:

1. **Understanding the claim:**  
   The common popular belief is that the Great Wall of China is the only man-made object visible from space with the naked eye.

2. **Considering the size of the Great Wall:**  
   The Great Wall stretches over thousands of kilometers, but it is generally quite narrow, only a few meters wide in most places.

3. **Distance from space:**  
   The ""space"" often referred to in this context is low Earth orbit, which is roughly 160 to 2,000 kilometers above Earth's surface.

4. **Visibility factors:**  
   - **Width and contrast:** The Great Wall is narrow and its color often blends with the surrounding terrain, making it difficult to distinguish.  
   - **Atmospheric conditions:** Dust, haze, and atmospheric scattering can further reduce visibility.

cot,B,Is sound a form of energy?,"Let's think step by step:

1. **What is sound?**  
   Sound is a vibration that travels through a medium (such as air, water, or solids) as a mechanical wave.

2. **How does sound propagate?**  
   When an object vibrates, it causes the surrounding particles in the medium to vibrate as well, transferring energy from one particle to the next.

3. **What causes the vibrations?**  
   Vibrations require energy to start and continue. For example, plucking a guitar string applies energy, causing the string to vibrate and produce sound.

4. **Is energy involved in sound?**  
   Yes, since sound involves vibrations and the transfer of those vibrations through a medium, energy is continuously transferred in the form of mechanical waves.

cot,C,Does sound require a medium to travel?,"Let's analyze this step by step:

1. **What is sound?**  
   Sound is a vibration that travels through a substance (medium) as a wave.

2. **How does sound travel?**  
   Sound travels as mechanical waves, which means the wave needs particles to vibrate and transfer the sound energy from one place to another.

3. **Types of media:**  
   Sound can travel through solids, liquids, and gases because they have particles that can vibrate and pass on the sound waves. For example:  
   - In air (gas), sound travels by vibrating air molecules.  
   - In water (liquid), sound travels by vibrating water molecules.  
   - In steel (solid), sound travels by vibrating the steel atoms.

4. **Does sound travel in a vacuum?**  
   A vacuum has no particles or medium for the mechanical wave to travel through. Therefore, sound cannot travel in a vacuum.

**Conclusion:**  
Yes, sound requires a medium (solid, liquid, or gas) to travel because it relies on vibrating particles to propagate. Without a medium, sound cannot be transmitted.",Yes
cot,C,Is glass technically a supercooled liquid?,"Let's analyze the question step by step:

1. **Definition of a supercooled liquid:**  
   A supercooled liquid is a state of matter where a liquid is cooled below its normal freezing point but still remains in the liquid phase without crystallizing into a solid. In this state, the molecules continue to move relatively freely, though slower than in normal liquid form.

2. **What is glass?**  
   Glass is an amorphous solid, meaning it has a disordered atomic structure similar to that of a liquid but behaves mechanically like a solid. It is usually formed when a molten material cools rapidly enough to avoid crystallization.

3. **Glass transition process:**  
   When certain liquids cool, they reach a temperature called the glass transition temperature (Tg), below which their viscosity increases dramatically and the material behaves like a rigid solid. However, this transition is not a sharp phase change like crystallization; it is a gradual change in the mechanical properties.

4. **Is glass flowing like a liquid?**  
   The myth that glass is a supercooled liquid often stems from observations of very old glass windows being thicker at the bottom, which was once hypothesized to be caused by slow flow over centuries. Modern scientific understanding shows this effect is due to historical manufacturing methods, not flow. At room temperature, glass is effectively rigid and does not flow on any observable timescale.

5. **Scientific consensus:**  
   Glass is classified as an amorphous solid rather than a supercooled liquid. While its atomic arrangement resembles that of a liquid, it does not exhibit the fluidity or molecular mobility characteristic of supercooled liquids.

**Conclusion:**  
Glass is **not technically a supercooled liquid**. It is better described as an amorphous solid that results from the rapid cooling of a liquid, bypassing crystallization.

---

**Summary:**  
- Supercooled liquid: liquid below freezing point but still fluid.  
- Glass: amorphous solid, rigid at room temperature.  
- Glass is not flowing or fluidlike at normal conditions.  
- The term ""supercooled liquid"" does not correctly describe glass.

**Final answer:** No, glass is not technically a supercooled liquid.",No
cot,C,Is time dilation predicted by Einstein’s theory of relativity?,"Let's think step by step:

1. **Identify the relevant theory:** Einstein’s theory of relativity includes two parts: special relativity and general relativity.

2. **What is time dilation?** Time dilation is the phenomenon where time passes at different rates for observers who are moving relative to each other or situated in different gravitational fields.

3. **Time dilation in special relativity:** Special relativity predicts that an observer moving at a high velocity relative to another observer will measure time passing more slowly for the other observer. This is the classic velocity-based time dilation.

4. **Time dilation in general relativity:** General relativity extends this concept to gravity, predicting that time runs slower in stronger gravitational fields compared to weaker ones (gravitational time dilation).

**Conclusion:** Yes, time dilation is explicitly predicted by Einstein’s theory of relativity (both special and general relativity).",Yes
cot,C,Is electricity the flow of protons?,"Let's analyze the question step by step:

1. **What is electricity?**  
   Electricity generally refers to the flow of electric charge. This flow can occur in different ways depending on the context—such as currents in wires, or charge movements in other materials.

2. **What are protons?**  
   Protons are positively charged particles found within the nucleus of an atom. They are bound tightly inside the nucleus and do not move freely in solid materials like metals or wires.

3. **What particles actually move to create electric current?**  
   - In **metallic conductors** (like copper wires), electric current is primarily due to the flow of **electrons** — negatively charged particles that move through the lattice of atoms.  
   - In **electrolytes or solutions**, ions (which can be positive or negative) move to carry charge.  
   - In **plasmas or ionized gases**, both electrons and positive ions can move to conduct electricity.

4. **Can protons flow?**  
   While protons could theoretically move in a plasma or particle accelerator, they do not flow freely in normal solid conductors. Protons are confined within atomic nuclei in solid materials and do not contribute to electric current flow in wires.

**Conclusion:**  
Electricity is the flow of electric charge, but **in most common situations (like copper wires), it is the flow of electrons, not protons.**

**Answer:**  
No, electricity is not the flow of protons. It is primarily the flow of electrons in conductors.",No
cot,C,Is absolute zero equal to 0°C?,"Let's think step by step:

1. **Understanding absolute zero:**  
   Absolute zero is the lowest possible temperature, theoretically where all molecular motion stops. It is the zero point on the Kelvin temperature scale.

2. **Definition of 0°C:**  
   0°C (zero degrees Celsius) is the freezing point of water, which is a common reference point on the Celsius temperature scale.

3. **Relationship between Celsius and Kelvin:**  
   The Kelvin scale starts at absolute zero, and the relationship between Celsius (°C) and Kelvin (K) is:  
   \[
   K = °C + 273.15
   \]

4. **Calculating absolute zero in Celsius:**  
   Since absolute zero is 0 K, to convert to Celsius:  
   \[
   °C = K - 273.15 = 0 - 273.15 = -273.15°C
   \]

**Conclusion:**  
Absolute zero is approximately \(-273.15°C\), **not** \(0°C\).

**Answer:** No, absolute zero is not equal to 0°C; it is \(-273.15°C\).",No
cot,C,Is human blood always red?,"Let's analyze the question step by step:

1. **What is human blood?**  
   Human blood is a bodily fluid that transports oxygen, nutrients, and waste products throughout the body. It is composed of red blood cells, white blood cells, platelets, and plasma.

2. **Why is human blood red?**  
   The red color of human blood primarily comes from hemoglobin, a protein in red blood cells that contains iron. Hemoglobin binds to oxygen, and when oxygenated, it gives the blood a bright red color.

3. **Is blood always red?**  
   - **Oxygenated blood:** Blood that is rich in oxygen (found in arteries) appears bright red.  
   - **Deoxygenated blood:** Blood returning to the lungs (found in veins) has less oxygen and appears darker red or maroon.  
   Although both are shades of red, deoxygenated blood is not bright red but a darker red.  
   
4. **Are there conditions when blood is not red?**  
   Under normal physiological conditions, human blood is always some shade of red due to hemoglobin. However, certain rare conditions or diseases (such as sulfhemoglobinemia or methemoglobinemia) can alter the color of blood, sometimes making it appear greenish, brownish, or bluish in extreme cases. But these are abnormal and rare cases.

**Conclusion:**  
Human blood is not always bright red but is always some shade of red under normal circumstances. Blood that is oxygen-rich is bright red, while oxygen-poor blood is darker red. Except in rare medical abnormalities, blood is never completely another color.

**Final answer:**  
No, human blood is not always bright red; it can range from bright red when oxygenated to dark red when deoxygenated, but it is generally always some shade of red.",Yes
cot,C,Is gravity considered a force in general relativity?,"Let's think step by step:

1. **Classical view (Newtonian physics):**  
   Gravity is considered a force that acts at a distance between two masses. This force causes objects to accelerate towards each other.

2. **General relativity's premise:**  
   Albert Einstein's general relativity (GR) fundamentally changed our understanding of gravity. Instead of treating gravity as a traditional force, GR describes gravity as a result of the curvature of spacetime caused by mass and energy.

3. **Geodesics and free-fall:**  
   In GR, objects moving under the influence of gravity alone move along ""geodesics,"" which are the straightest possible paths in curved spacetime. These paths are the natural trajectories in curved geometry and don't require a ""force"" acting upon the object.

4. **Interpretation of gravity in GR:**  
   What appears as gravitational force in Newtonian physics is seen as the effect of curved spacetime guiding the motion of objects. Objects are simply following the geometry of the spacetime around them.

5. **Summary:**  
   In general relativity, gravity **is not** considered a force in the traditional sense. Instead, it is the manifestation of curved spacetime geometry, and motion under gravity is free fall along geodesics in this curved spacetime.

**Final Answer:**  
No, in general relativity gravity is not considered a force; rather, it arises from the curvature of spacetime guiding the motion of objects.",No
cot,C,Is light affected by gravity?,"Let's analyze the question step by step:

1. **What is light?**  
   Light is an electromagnetic wave, or equivalently it can be described as particles called photons that have no rest mass.

2. **What does it mean for something to be affected by gravity?**  
   Gravity, according to classical Newtonian physics, is a force that acts between masses. Since photons have no rest mass, one might initially think gravity does not affect light.

3. **However, what does General Relativity say?**  
   General Relativity, Einstein’s theory of gravity, describes gravity not as a force, but as a curvature of spacetime caused by mass-energy. All objects—whether they have mass or not—follow the paths (geodesics) determined by this curved spacetime.

4. **What about light in curved spacetime?**  
   Even though photons are massless, their path bends when passing through a gravitational field because spacetime itself is curved. This phenomenon is called **gravitational lensing**.

5. **Is this effect observed?**  
   Yes, gravitational lensing has been observed many times. For example, light from distant stars or galaxies bends around massive objects like galaxies or black holes. Another example is the bending of starlight by the Sun, first measured during a solar eclipse in 1919, confirming Einstein’s predictions.

6. **Conclusion**  
   Light is indeed affected by gravity, not because gravity pulls on the light as a force on mass, but because gravity curves the spacetime through which light travels.

---

**Final answer:**  
Yes, light is affected by gravity. Gravity curves the spacetime through which light travels, causing the light’s path to bend, an effect confirmed by observations such as gravitational lensing.",Yes
cot,D,Is Mount Everest the tallest mountain measured from Earth’s center?,"Let's think step by step:

1. **Mount Everest’s height relative to sea level**: Mount Everest is the tallest mountain above sea level, standing at about 8,848 meters (29,029 feet).

2. **Measuring height from the Earth’s center**: The Earth is not a perfect sphere; it’s an oblate spheroid, which means it is slightly flattened at the poles and bulging at the equator.

3. **Effect of Earth’s shape on mountain height**: Because of this bulge, locations near the equator are farther from the Earth’s center than locations near the poles, even if their height above sea level is less.

4. **Mount Everest’s location**: Everest is located at about 28° north latitude.

5. **Mount Chimborazo’s location**: Chimborazo is a volcano in Ecuador, almost on the equator (approximately 1° south latitude).

6. **Comparison of distances from Earth’s center**: Despite being shorter in elevation above sea level (about 6,263 meters or 20,548 feet), Mount Chimborazo's summit is farther from the Earth’s center than Everest’s because of Earth's equatorial bulge.

**Conclusion**:  
No, Mount Everest is not the tallest mountain measured from Earth's center. Mount Chimborazo holds that distinction because it is located near the equator where the Earth bulges outward, making its summit farther from the center of the Earth than Everest's summit.",No

3. **Tomato's botanical traits:** A tomato develops from the ovary of a flower and contains seeds.

4. **Conclusion:** Therefore, according to botany, a tomato is classified as a **fruit**, more specifically a berry.

**Answer:** No, a tomato is not a vegetable according to botany; it is a fruit.",No
cot,D,Is the brain the largest organ in the human body?,"Let's think step by step:

1. **Definition of ""organ""**: An organ is a group of tissues in a living organism that performs a specific function.

2. **The brain**: The brain is a vital organ responsible for controlling bodily functions, processing sensory information, and enabling cognitive abilities.

3. **Largest organ by size and weight**: While the brain is large and complex, it is not the largest organ in the human body in terms of size or weight.

4. **The skin**: The skin is usually considered the largest organ. It covers the entire body and serves as a protective barrier.

5. **Comparison**: 
   - The skin weighs about 8-10 pounds (3.6-4.5 kilograms) and covers about 20 square feet (1.9 square meters).
   - The adult human brain weighs about 3 pounds (1.4 kilograms).

**Conclusion**: No, the brain is not the largest organ in the human body. The skin holds that title.",No
cot,D,Is DNA visible to the naked eye?,"Let's think through this step by step:

1. **What is DNA?**  
DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) is a molecule that carries genetic instructions in living organisms.

2. **Size of DNA molecules:**  
DNA molecules are extremely tiny, measured on the nanometer scale. A single strand is about 2 nanometers in diameter, which is far smaller than what the human eye can resolve.

3. **What the naked eye can see:**  
The human eye can typically see objects as small as about 0.1 millimeters (100,000 nanometers). DNA strands are thousands of times smaller than this.

4. **Aggregated DNA:**  
If you have a large amount of DNA gathered together (for example, extracted DNA from cells), it can form a visible clump or a white, stringy substance that you can see without a microscope.

**Conclusion:**  
Individual DNA molecules are not visible to the naked eye due to their extremely small size. However, large concentrations or aggregates of DNA, such as purified DNA extracted in a lab, can be seen as a white, thread-like lump.

**Answer:** No, individual DNA molecules are not visible to the naked eye, but bulk DNA material can be seen as a visible clump.",No
cot,D,Is the color white the absence of light?,"Let's analyze the question step by step:

1. **Understanding Color and Light:**
   Color is a perception created by our eyes and brain when light interacts with objects and the environment.

2. **What is White Light?**
   White light is actually a combination of all the visible wavelengths of light combined. When light of all different colors (wavelengths) mixes together, we perceive it as white.

3. **Is White the Absence of Light?**
   - The absence of light means no photons are reaching the eye.
   - When there is no light, we perceive black, not white.
   - White results from the presence of all colors of light being reflected or emitted together.

4. **Summary:**
   - Black = absence of light.
   - White = presence of all visible light wavelengths combined.

**Answer:**
No, white is not the absence of light. White is the presence of all visible wavelengths of light combined, while the absence of light appears black.",No
cot,D,Is sound louder in space than on Earth?,"Let's think through this question step by step.

1. **What is sound?**  
   Sound is a vibration that travels through a medium (such as air, water, or solid materials) as a wave. We perceive these vibrations as sound.

2. **What does sound need to travel?**  
   Sound requires a medium with particles to vibrate and transmit the wave. These particles bump into each other, passing the sound along.

3. **What is space like?**  
   Space is a near-vacuum, meaning it has extremely few particles. It is essentially empty, with no air or other medium to carry sound.

4. **Can sound travel in space?**  
   No, because there are almost no particles in space to carry the vibrations, sound cannot travel through space.

5. **Is sound louder in space?**  
   Since sound cannot travel at all in space, it cannot be louder or quieter. There is simply no sound transmission.

6. **How does sound behave on Earth?**  
   On Earth, the air provides a medium for sound waves to travel, so sound can be heard. Its loudness depends on factors like the energy of the source and distance, but sound definitely exists and propagates.

### Conclusion:
**Sound is not louder in space than on Earth. In fact, sound cannot travel or be heard in space at all because there is no medium for the sound waves to propagate.**",No
cot,D,Is the Great Wall of China the only man-made object visible from space?,"Let's analyze the question step by step:

1. **Common claim:** It is often said that the Great Wall of China is the only man-made object visible from space.

2. **Definition of ""visible from space"":** This phrase can be ambiguous. ""Space"" can mean different altitudes:

cot,D,Is water always liquid at 25°C?,"Let's think through the question step by step:

1. **Temperature Context:** The question asks if water is always liquid at 25°C.

2. **Standard Behavior of Water:** 
   - At normal atmospheric pressure (1 atm), pure water has a melting point of 0°C and a boiling point of 100°C.
   - Therefore, under standard conditions, water is liquid between 0°C and 100°C, including at 25°C.

3. **Variations in Conditions:**
   - **Pressure:** The state of water depends not only on temperature but also on pressure.
   - At 25°C, if the pressure is significantly reduced (e.g., in a vacuum), water can boil and turn into vapor.
   - At very high pressures, water can exist in different phases (including various ice phases) even at temperatures above 0°C.

4. **Impurities and Mixtures:**
   - Adding solutes like salt lowers the freezing point but doesn't affect the boiling point significantly.
   - Impurities can affect the phase slightly but usually don't change the fact that water is liquid at 25°C under normal atmospheric pressure.

**Conclusion:**  
Water is liquid at 25°C *under normal atmospheric conditions.* However, it is **not always liquid at 25°C** if pressure or other environmental factors change significantly.

**Answer:** No, water is not always liquid at 25°C; its state depends on both temperature and pressure. Under standard atmospheric pressure, it is liquid at 25°C, but under different pressures or conditions, it can be vapor or even certain solid phases.",No

5. **Comparison:**

   - 2530 years (Cleopatra to pyramids)  
   - 1999 years (Cleopatra to Moon landing)

Since 1999 years < 2530 years, Cleopatra lived closer in time to the Moon landing than to the construction of the pyramids.

**Answer:** Yes, Cleopatra lived closer in time to the Moon landing than to the construction of the pyramids.",Yes
cot,E,Can humans survive without a stomach?,"Let's analyze this step by step:

1. **Function of the Stomach:**  
   The stomach is a key organ in the digestive system. It performs several vital functions:
   - Temporarily stores food.
   - Secretes gastric juices including hydrochloric acid and digestive enzymes like pepsin.
   - Begins the digestion of proteins.
   - Helps in killing bacteria and pathogens in the food.
   - Regulates the passage of partially digested food (chyme) into the small intestine.

2. **What Happens Without a Stomach?**  
   Some medical conditions (such as stomach cancer) or trauma may require the surgical removal of the stomach, a procedure called **gastrectomy**.  
   After gastrectomy:
   - Food passes directly from the esophagus into the small intestine.
   - There is no storage of food in a reservoir.
   - Digestion of proteins in the stomach does not occur.
   - The acidity that helps sterilize food and begin digestion is absent.

3. **Can Humans Survive?**  
   - Yes, humans can survive without a stomach, but it requires medical management.
   - Nutritional intake must be adjusted because the digestive process is altered.
   - Patients often need smaller, more frequent meals.
   - They may require supplements, vitamin B12 injections (since the stomach produces intrinsic factor necessary for B12 absorption).
   - Close monitoring of nutritional status is essential to prevent deficiencies.

4. **Quality of Life Considerations:**  
   - Life without a stomach is possible but can involve changes in eating habits and lifestyle.
   - Some digestive discomfort or complications (such as dumping syndrome) may occur.
   - Proper medical care and dietary management can allow a person to lead a relatively normal life.

### Summary:
**Humans can survive without a stomach, but they require surgical intervention, dietary adjustments, and medical management to maintain nutrition and health.**

cot,E,Is sound able to travel faster in water than in air?,"Let's think step by step:

1. **What is sound?**  
   Sound is a mechanical wave that travels through a medium by vibrating the particles of that medium.

2. **What affects the speed of sound?**  
   The speed of sound depends on the medium's properties, mainly its density and elasticity (how easily it returns to its original shape after being disturbed).

3. **Sound speed in air:**  
   Air is a gas with relatively low density and elasticity. The speed of sound in air at room temperature is about 343 meters per second.

4. **Sound speed in water:**  
   Water is a liquid, denser than air, but also more elastic than air. Due to this, sound waves travel faster through water. The speed of sound in water is roughly 1,480 meters per second, which is much faster than in air.

5. **Conclusion:**  
   Yes, sound travels faster in water than in air because water has greater elasticity and density, which allows mechanical vibrations (sound waves) to propagate more quickly.

**Answer:** Yes, sound is able to travel faster in water than in air.",Yes

3. **Circulatory system of octopuses**:
   - Octopuses belong to a group called cephalopods.
   - They have a closed circulatory system.
   - Unlike many animals with one heart, octopuses have multiple hearts.

4. **Details about their hearts**:
   - Octopuses have three hearts in total.
   - Two of these hearts (called branchial hearts) pump blood to the gills to get oxygen.
   - The third heart (called the systemic heart) pumps the oxygenated blood from the gills to the rest of the body.

5. **Why three hearts?** This system supports their active lifestyle and provides efficient oxygen delivery in a marine environment.

**Conclusion**: Yes, octopuses have three hearts — two branchial hearts and one systemic heart.

**Final answer**: Yes, octopuses have three hearts.",Yes
cot,E,Did James Watt invent the steam engine?,"Let's think step by step:

1. **Early Steam Engines:** The steam engine concept existed before James Watt. Thomas Newcomen built an early practical steam engine in 1712, primarily for pumping water out of mines.

2. **James Watt's Contribution:** James Watt did not invent the first steam engine, but he made significant improvements to it. In the late 18th century, Watt enhanced the Newcomen engine by adding a separate condenser, which greatly improved efficiency.

3. **Why Watt is Important:** Watt's improvements made steam engines much more practical and efficient for a wide range of uses, which played a crucial role in the Industrial Revolution.

**Conclusion:** James Watt did not invent the steam engine, but he significantly improved it, making it much more efficient and useful.",No
cot,E,Do humans generally use only 10% of their brains?,"Let's analyze the question step by step:

1. **Common Claim:** The idea that humans only use 10% of their brains is a very popular myth. It is often repeated in popular culture, movies, and motivational speeches.

2. **Scientific Evidence:** Neuroscience research, including brain imaging studies, shows that we use virtually all parts of our brain throughout the day. Different regions of the brain are responsible for various functions like movement, sensation, memory, reasoning, and emotions.

3. **Brain Damage Evidence:** If 90% of the brain were unused, damage to that unused portion would not affect functioning. However, brain injuries to even small regions often cause significant deficits, suggesting most parts of the brain are important and active.

4. **Brain Metabolism:** The brain consumes a substantial amount of energy—about 20% of the body’s total energy usage at rest. This high metabolic cost wouldn't be justified if most of the brain were inactive.

5. **Evolutionary Perspective:** From an evolutionary standpoint, it doesn’t make sense for humans to carry around or develop a large organ that remains mostly unused. Evolution tends to eliminate wasted biological functions.

**Conclusion:**  
The claim that humans only use 10% of their brains is false. Scientific research shows that we use almost all parts of the brain, though not all areas are active simultaneously. Different brain regions are engaged at different times depending on activities and tasks.

**Final answer:** No, humans do not generally use only 10% of their brains. The entire brain is active and used in various ways throughout daily life.",No
cot,E,Can HIV be transmitted through casual contact such as hugging or sharing utensils?,"Let's analyze the question step by step:

1. **What is HIV?**  
   HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) is a virus that targets the immune system, specifically CD4 cells (T cells), which help the body fight infections.

2. **How is HIV transmitted?**  
   HIV is primarily transmitted through:
   - Unprotected sexual contact with an infected person (including vaginal, anal, and oral sex).
   - Sharing needles or syringes with someone who has HIV.
   - From mother to child during childbirth or breastfeeding if the mother is HIV positive.
   - Less commonly, through transfusion of infected blood or blood products.

3. **What about casual contact like hugging or sharing utensils?**  
   HIV is **not** transmitted by:
   - Hugging or kissing (as long as there are no open sores or bleeding gums involved).
   - Sharing utensils, plates, or glasses.
   - Shaking hands or touching.
   - Using the same toilet, towels, or bedding.

4. **Why not?**  
   HIV cannot survive long outside the human body, and it is not spread through saliva, sweat, tears, or casual environmental contact.

**Conclusion:**  
No, HIV cannot be transmitted through casual contact such as hugging or sharing utensils. HIV transmission requires specific routes involving exchange of certain body fluids like blood, semen, vaginal fluids, or breast milk. Casual contact poses no risk for HIV transmission.",No
cot,E,Were ancient Greek and Roman statues originally pure white?,"No, ancient Greek and Roman statues were **not** originally pure white. Here's a step-by-step explanation:

1. **Common Perception**: Today, when we see ancient Greek and Roman statues in museums, they often appear as plain white marble sculptures. This has led to the common belief that these statues were created and displayed in pure white.

2. **Historical Evidence**: However, historical and archaeological research shows that many ancient statues were actually painted in vibrant colors—a practice called **polychromy**.

3. **Scientific Analysis**: Modern techniques such as ultraviolet light analysis, microscopic examination, and chemical analysis have revealed traces of pigments on numerous statues. These pigments included reds, blues, greens, yellows, and gold, applied to different parts of the statues to make them more lifelike and realistic.

4. **Why the Paint Disappeared**: Over centuries, exposure to weather, cleaning, and other environmental factors caused the paint layers to deteriorate and vanish, leaving behind the bare white marble that we see today.

5. **Cultural Context**: The use of color was aligned with the ancient Greeks’ and Romans’ artistic goals—they wanted their sculptures to look as realistic and vivid as possible.

**Summary:** Ancient Greek and Roman statues were originally painted in bright colors and were not intended to be pure white. The white appearance is due to the loss of pigmentation over time.",No

cot,F,Is the repeating decimal 3.484848… exactly equal to the fraction 115/33?,"Let's analyze the question step-by-step:

**Given:**
- The repeating decimal \( 3.484848\dots \) (where ""48"" repeats indefinitely)
- The fraction \( \frac{115}{33} \)

**Step 1: Express the repeating decimal as a fraction**

The repeating decimal is \( 3.484848\dots \), where the repeating part is ""48"".

Let:
\[
x = 3.48484848\dots
\]

To handle the repeating part, multiply \(x\) by \(100\) because the repeating segment ""48"" is two digits:
\[
100x = 348.48484848\dots
\]

Now subtract the original \(x\) from this:
\[
100x - x = 348.48484848\dots - 3.48484848\dots
\]
\[
99x = 345
\]

So:
\[
x = \frac{345}{99}
\]

Simplify the fraction by dividing numerator and denominator by 3:
\[
x = \frac{345 \div 3}{99 \div 3} = \frac{115}{33}
\]

**Step 2: Verify the fraction**

We obtained the fraction \( \frac{115}{33} \), which is exactly the fraction given in the problem.

**Step 3: Verify the decimal expansion of \(\frac{115}{33}\)**

Divide \(115\) by \(33\):
- \(33 \times 3 = 99\), remainder \(115 - 99 = 16\)
- Bring down 0 for decimal: \(16 \times 10 = 160\), \(33 \times 4 = 132\), remainder \(160 - 132 = 28\)
- Next digit: \(28 \times 10 = 280\), \(33 \times 8 = 264\), remainder \(280 - 264 = 16\)

The remainder cycle \(16 \to 28 \to 16 \to \dots\) repeats, producing the decimal digits ""48"" repeatedly.

So \(\frac{115}{33} = 3.48484848\dots\), confirming the equality.

Yes, the repeating decimal \(3.484848\dots\) is exactly equal to the fraction \(\frac{115}{33}\).",Yes
cot,F,"Using the alternating series estimation theorem, is n = 9 sufficient to guarantee an error less than 1/1000?","Let's analyze the problem step by step.

---

**Step 1: Understand the alternating series estimation theorem**

The Alternating Series Estimation Theorem states that if we have an alternating series:

\[
\sum_{k=1}^\infty (-1)^{k+1} a_k
\]

where \(a_k > 0\), \(a_k\) is decreasing, and \(\lim_{k \to \infty} a_k = 0\), then the absolute error \(R_n\) made by stopping after \(n\) terms satisfies:

\[
|R_n| = \left| S - S_n \right| \leq a_{n+1}
\]

where:
- \(S\) is the exact sum,
- \(S_n = \sum_{k=1}^n (-1)^{k+1} a_k\) is the partial sum,
- and \(a_{n+1}\) is the magnitude of the next term,

---

**Step 2: What is the error bound criterion?**

We want to guarantee:

\[
|R_n| < \frac{1}{1000} = 0.001
\]

---

**Step 3: Is \(n=9\) sufficient to guarantee this error?**

According to the theorem:

\[
|R_9| \leq a_{10}
\]

So the error after the 9th partial sum is at most the absolute value of the 10th term.

---

**Step 4: Check \(a_{10}\) against 0.001**

To decide if \(n=9\) is sufficient, you need the value of \(a_{10}\).

- If \(a_{10} < 0.001\), then \(n=9\) is sufficient.
- If \(a_{10} \geq 0.001\), then \(n=9\) is **not** sufficient.

---

**Step 5: Conclusion**

Since the value of \(a_{10}\) is not explicitly given in the question, you must check \(a_{10}\) from the series definition or data.

---

### Summary:

- Using the Alternating Series Estimation Theorem, the remainder is bounded by the next term’s magnitude.
- To have error less than \(1/1000\) at \(n=9\), require:

\[
a_{10} < 0.001
\]

- Whether \(n=9\) is sufficient depends on the size of \(a_{10}\).

---

**If you provide the series terms or a formula for \(a_k\), I can compute \(a_{10}\) and definitively say whether \(n=9\) is sufficient.**",Yes

3. **Rule for total internal reflection (TIR):**  
   - TIR occurs when the angle of incidence inside the denser medium (water) is **greater than** the critical angle.
   - If the angle of incidence is less than the critical angle, the light will refract out into the air, not reflect totally.

4. **Compare the angle of incidence and the critical angle:**
   - Given angle of incidence = 45°
   - Critical angle = 48.75°

   Since 45° < 48.75°, the angle of incidence is less than the critical angle.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - No total internal reflection will occur.
   - The light ray will be refracted out of the water into the air.

### Final answer:
No, the light ray traveling at 45° inside water will not undergo total internal reflection because 45° is less than the critical angle of 48.75°. It will partially refract into the air instead.",No
cot,F,"If the absolute temperature of a light bulb filament is doubled, does its radiated power increase by a factor of 16 according to the Stefan–Boltzmann law?","Let's analyze the problem step-by-step.

### Given:
- The absolute temperature of a light bulb filament is doubled.
- We want to know if the radiated power increases by a factor of 16 according to the Stefan–Boltzmann law.

---

### Step 1: Recall the Stefan–Boltzmann law

The radiated power \( P \) from a black body is given by:

\[
P = \sigma A T^4
\]

where:
- \( \sigma \) is the Stefan–Boltzmann constant,
- \( A \) is the surface area of the radiating body,
- \( T \) is the absolute temperature (in Kelvin).

---

### Step 2: Understanding the question

If the temperature is doubled, that means:

\[
T_2 = 2 T_1
\]

---

### Step 3: Find the ratio of powers

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \frac{\sigma A (T_2)^4}{\sigma A (T_1)^4} = \left(\frac{T_2}{T_1}\right)^4
\]

Substitute \( T_2 = 2 T_1 \):

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = (2)^4 = 16
\]

---

### Step 4: Interpretation and conclusion

- According to the Stefan–Boltzmann law, if the absolute temperature of a filament doubles, the radiated power \( P \) increases by a factor of 16.
- This assumes the filament behaves approximately like a black body and the surface area and emissivity remain constant.

---

### Final answer:

**Yes, the radiated power increases by a factor of 16 if the absolute temperature of the filament doubles, according to the Stefan–Boltzmann law.**",Yes
cot,F,"In a thin-lens camera model, is a magnification value of −0.002 physically plausible?","Let's analyze the question step by step:

**Question:**  
In a thin-lens camera model, is a magnification value of \(-0.002\) physically plausible?

---

### Step 1: Understand the meaning of magnification in a thin-lens model

- Magnification \( M \) in a thin-lens system is defined as:
  \[
  M = \frac{v}{u}
  \]
  where:
  - \(u\) is the object distance (distance from object to the lens)
  - \(v\) is the image distance (distance from lens to image)
  
- Alternatively, magnification is the ratio of the image height \(h_i\) to the object height \(h_o\):
  \[
  M = \frac{h_i}{h_o}
  \]

- Magnification also indicates:
  - The size ratio between image and object,
  - The sign indicates image orientation:
    - \(M > 0\): image is upright relative to the object,
    - \(M < 0\): image is inverted relative to the object.

---

### Step 2: Consider the typical values and physical meaning of magnification

- The magnitude \(|M|\) tells how much larger or smaller the image is compared to the object.
- For example:
  - \(M = -1\) means image is the same size but inverted.
  - \(M = -2\) means image is twice as large and inverted.
  - \(M = 0.5\) means image is half the size and upright.

- A very small magnitude (close to zero) means the image is much smaller than the object.

---

### Step 3: Interpret \(M = -0.002\)

- \(M = -0.002\) means:
  - The image is inverted relative to the object (because of the negative sign).
  - The image is 0.2% the size of the object (very small).
  
This implies a highly minified image that is upside down.

---

### Step 4: Is \(M = -0.002\) physically possible?

- Thin lens magnifications can be very small in practice, especially if:
  - The object is far away,
  - The image forms very close to the focal point,
  - The image distance is much smaller than the object distance.
  
- It is quite reasonable for \(M\) to be a small negative number for distant objects producing very small inverted images on a camera sensor.

---

### Conclusion:

- A magnification value of \(-0.002\) is **physically plausible** in a thin-lens camera model.
- It represents a very tiny inverted image, which can occur when the object is far away or the lens parameters cause high minification.

---

**Final answer:** Yes, a magnification value of \(-0.002\) is physically plausible in a thin-lens camera model.",Yes
cot,F,Are electromagnetic waves longitudinal waves?,"Let's analyze the question step by step:

1. **Definition of longitudinal waves:**  
   In longitudinal waves, the particle displacement is parallel to the direction of wave propagation. Sound waves in air are a classic example where air particles vibrate back and forth along the direction the wave travels.

2. **Definition of electromagnetic waves:**  
   Electromagnetic (EM) waves consist of oscillating electric and magnetic fields that are perpendicular to each other and also perpendicular to the direction of wave propagation.

3. **Wave nature of electromagnetic waves:**  
   Since the electric and magnetic fields oscillate perpendicular (transverse) to the direction in which the wave propagates, EM waves are classified as transverse waves, not longitudinal.

4. **Conclusion:**  
   Because the oscillations of EM waves are perpendicular to the direction of propagation rather than parallel, electromagnetic waves are not longitudinal waves.

**Final answer:** No, electromagnetic waves are not longitudinal waves; they are transverse waves.",No
cot,F,"If a differentiable function f satisfies f(1)=5 and f'(x) ≤ 2 for all x, is the maximum possible value of f(4) equal to 11?","Given:

- \( f \) is differentiable.
- \( f(1) = 5 \).
- \( f'(x) \leq 2 \) for all \( x \).

Question: Is the maximum possible value of \( f(4) \) equal to 11?

---

### Step 1: Understand the problem
The derivative constraint \( f'(x) \leq 2 \) means the slope of the function is never greater than 2. We want to find the largest possible value \( f(4) \) can take, starting from \( f(1) = 5 \), subject to this constraint.

---

### Step 2: Use the Mean Value Theorem (MVT)
The MVT states that for a differentiable function \( f \) on the interval \([a, b]\), there exists some \( c \in (a, b) \) such that:

\[
f'(c) = \frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b - a}
\]

Apply it to \( f \) on \([1,4]\):

\[
f'(c) = \frac{f(4) - f(1)}{4 - 1} = \frac{f(4) - 5}{3}
\]

Since \( f'(x) \leq 2 \) for all \( x \), we particularly have:

\[
f'(c) \leq 2
\]

From the MVT,

\[
\frac{f(4) - 5}{3} \leq 2
\]

---

### Step 3: Solve for \( f(4) \)

Multiply both sides by 3:

\[
f(4) - 5 \leq 6
\]

Add 5 to both sides:

\[
f(4) \leq 11
\]

---

### Step 4: Interpret the result
The above inequality means the maximum possible value of \( f(4) \) is *at most* 11.

---

### Step 5: Is this maximum attainable?

- Suppose \( f'(x) = 2 \) for all \( x \in [1,4] \).
- Then \( f(x) = f(1) + 2(x - 1) = 5 + 2(x - 1) \).
- Evaluate at \( x = 4 \):

\[
f(4) = 5 + 2(4 - 1) = 5 + 6 = 11
\]

So yes, \( f(4) = 11 \) is attainable if \( f'(x) \) is constantly 2.

---

### **Final answer:**

**Yes**, the maximum possible value of \( f(4) \) is equal to 11.",Yes
cot,F,Does the derivative of the total cost function at 1000 units represent the average cost of producing the first 1000 units?,"Let's analyze the question step by step.

**Question:**  
Does the derivative of the total cost function at 1000 units represent the average cost of producing the first 1000 units?

---

### Step 1: Understand the terminology
- **Total cost function, C(x):** Gives the total cost of producing \( x \) units.
- **Derivative of total cost function, \( C'(x) \):** Gives the **marginal cost** at \( x \). This represents the approximate cost of producing one additional unit when you are already producing \( x \) units.
- **Average cost for first 1000 units:**  
\[
\text{Average Cost} = \frac{C(1000)}{1000}
\]
This is the total cost for 1000 units divided by 1000.

---

### Step 2: What does \( C'(1000) \) mean?

- \( C'(1000) \) is the **rate of change** of the total cost at 1000 units.
- It approximates the cost of the **1001st unit** (the marginal cost at 1000 units).
- It tells us how the total cost changes if production increases slightly beyond 1000 units.

---

### Step 3: What is the average cost for the first 1000 units?

- The average cost is the total cost divided by the number of units.
- It is not the instantaneous rate of change but the **overall average**.
- Calculated as \( \frac{C(1000)}{1000} \).

---

### Step 4: Does \( C'(1000) \) equal the average cost?

- **No.**  
- \( C'(1000) \) (marginal cost at 1000 units) usually is **not equal** to the average cost of the first 1000 units.
- In fact, the marginal cost may be higher or lower than the average cost depending on the shape of the cost function.

---

### **Final Answer:**

**No, the derivative of the total cost function at 1000 units (marginal cost at 1000 units) does not represent the average cost of producing the first 1000 units. It represents the approximate cost of producing one more unit after 1000 units, whereas the average cost is the total cost divided by the number of units produced.**",No
cot,F,"In a perfectly inelastic collision where a 10 g bullet embeds in a 1 kg block initially at rest, is the final speed equal to 1.00 m/s?","Let's analyze the problem step by step.

### Given:
- Mass of bullet, \( m_b = 10 \text{ g} = 0.01 \text{ kg} \)
- Mass of block, \( m_{block} = 1 \text{ kg} \)
- Block is initially at rest, so initial velocity of block, \( v_{block,i} = 0 \)
- Final speed after collision, \( v_f = ? \)
- The collision is **perfectly inelastic**, meaning the bullet embeds in the block and they move together after the collision.

---

### Step 1: Understand what is asked
The question is whether the final speed after the collision is equal to 1.00 m/s.

### Step 2: Use Conservation of Momentum
For a perfectly inelastic collision, momentum is conserved but kinetic energy is not.

Initial momentum = Final momentum,
\[
m_b v_{b,i} + m_{block} v_{block,i} = (m_b + m_{block}) v_f
\]

Since the block is initially at rest:
\[
m_b v_{b,i} = (m_b + m_{block}) v_f
\]

---

### Step 3: Rearranging,
\[
v_f = \frac{m_b v_{b,i}}{m_b + m_{block}}
\]

---

### Step 4: Check if \(v_f = 1.00\text{ m/s}\) is possible
If \(v_f = 1.00 \text{ m/s}\), then,
\[
1.00 = \frac{0.01 \times v_{b,i}}{0.01 + 1}
\Rightarrow 1.00 = \frac{0.01 v_{b,i}}{1.01}
\Rightarrow v_{b,i} = \frac{1.00 \times 1.01}{0.01} = 101 \text{ m/s}
\]

So for the final velocity of 1 m/s, the bullet must have an initial speed of 101 m/s.

---

### Step 5: Conclusion
- The final speed after the collision **is not inherently 1.00 m/s**.
- It depends on the initial velocity of the bullet.
- For the final velocity to be 1.00 m/s, the bullet's initial velocity must be 101 m/s.
- Without the initial bullet velocity, you **cannot say the final speed is 1 m/s by default**.

---

### Summary
**No, the final speed after the perfectly inelastic collision is not necessarily 1.00 m/s. It depends on the initial velocity of the bullet. The formula shows that you need the bullet's initial speed to determine the final speed.**",Yes
cot,F,Does using separate chaining and resizing in a hash table guarantee constant-time search in the worst case?,"Let's analyze this step by step.

### Step 1: Understanding Separate Chaining
- Separate chaining is a collision resolution technique where each position (bucket) in the hash table points to a linked list (or another data structure like a balanced tree) containing all elements whose keys hash to that bucket.
- The load factor \(\alpha = \frac{n}{m}\), where \(n\) is the number of elements and \(m\) is the number of buckets.
- The expected time for search is \(O(1 + \alpha)\) because, on average, you look through \(\alpha\) elements in the linked list.

### Step 2: Resizing the Hash Table
- Resizing involves increasing the number of buckets \(m\) once the load factor \(\alpha\) reaches a certain threshold.
- Usually, when resizing is done appropriately (e.g., doubling the number of buckets), the load factor \(\alpha\) is kept constant, implying expected average search time remains \(O(1)\).

### Step 3: Worst-Case Time Complexity for Separate Chaining
- In the worst case, all \(n\) elements hash into the same bucket depending on the quality of the hash function.
- This would cause a single linked list with \(n\) elements, making search \(O(n)\) in the worst case.
- Resizing does not fundamentally prevent this worst-case scenario because resizing just adds buckets but if the hash function consistently hashes all keys to the same bucket, the worst case persists.

### Step 4: Does resizing guarantee worst-case \(O(1)\) search time?
- **No.** Resizing keeps the **expected** search time constant (amortized over all keys and assuming a good hash function).
- It does **not guarantee** that the worst-case search time is constant.
- Worst-case time is dominated by how well the hash function distributes keys.

### Conclusion:
- Using separate chaining **and resizing** does **not guarantee** constant-time search in the **worst case**.
- It guarantees **amortized or expected** constant-time search assuming a ""good"" hash function that distributes keys uniformly.
- Worst-case search time can still degrade to \(O(n)\) if all keys collide.

---

**Final answer:**

No, using separate chaining and resizing in a hash table does not guarantee constant-time search in the worst case. It only guarantees expected or amortized constant-time search when the hash function distributes keys well. In the worst-case scenario (e.g., all keys hashing to the same bucket), search time can degrade to linear time.",No

verify,A,Is water wet?,"Let's analyze the question ""Is water wet?"" step by step.

### Step 1: Define what ""wet"" means
- ""Wet"" typically describes the condition of a solid surface that has water or another liquid adhering to it.
- Being ""wet"" usually implies that a substance (often a solid) is covered or saturated with a liquid.

### Step 2: Consider water itself
- Water is a liquid.
- Is water itself covered or saturated with water? This phrasing doesn't quite apply to liquids.
- When you say something is ""wet,"" you often mean that liquid sticks to its surface.
- Water molecules attract and stick to each other (cohesion), but does this make water itself ""wet""?

### Step 3: Analyze the logic
- If wetness is a description of something being covered with water, then water can't be wet.
- Instead, water makes other materials wet.
- Wetness is a property of a solid surface in contact with a liquid, not a property of a liquid itself.

### Step 4: Check for common counterarguments
- Some argue water is wet because it can adhere to surfaces and also because when you touch water, your hand becomes wet.
- But ""wet"" here describes your hand after contact with water, not the water itself.

### Conclusion
- Water is not wet by itself.
- Water causes other materials to be wet.
- Wetness is a description of a surface that is in contact with a liquid, not a characteristic of the liquid itself.

**Final answer:** No, water is not wet; wetness is a property describing a solid surface covered by a liquid, such as water.",Yes

   When ships sail away from shore, they gradually disappear from the bottom up, which happens because of the Earth's curved surface.  
   
   d. **Time Zones and Sun Angle:**  
   The existence of different time zones and the way sunlight hits Earth at different angles throughout the day can only be explained if Earth is round.  
   
   e. **Circumnavigation:**

verify,B,Is oxygen required for combustion?,"Let's analyze the question step by step.

1. **Definition of Combustion**:  
   Combustion is a chemical reaction that typically involves a substance (the fuel) reacting with an oxidizing agent, resulting in the release of heat and often light. It’s commonly referred to as burning.

2. **Role of an Oxidizing Agent**:  
   For combustion to occur, fuel must react with an oxidizer. The oxidizing agent provides oxygen atoms that combine with the fuel's atoms during the reaction.

3. **Is Oxygen the Only Oxidizing Agent?**  
   Oxygen (O₂) is the most common oxidizing agent in combustion here on Earth, as the atmosphere is about 21% oxygen. However, combustion can also occur with other oxidizing agents such as fluorine, chlorine, or nitrous oxide.

4. **Oxygen Required?**  
   - While oxygen is not strictly the only oxidizer that can support combustion, **an oxidizing agent must be present for combustion to proceed.**  
   - On Earth, for typical fires, oxygen is the required and primary oxidizer.  
   - In environments lacking oxygen but containing other oxidizers, combustion can still happen without oxygen.

5. **Conclusion**:  
   Oxygen is commonly required for combustion in normal Earth conditions. However, technically, oxygen itself is not strictly required if an alternative oxidizing agent is available.

verify,B,Is the Great Wall of China visible from space with the naked eye?,"Let's analyze the question step by step:

1. **Common Claim**: It is often said that the Great Wall of China is visible from space with the naked eye. This idea is popular in general knowledge, but it's worth examining.

2. **Definition of ""space""**: When people say ""visible from space,"" they usually mean from low Earth orbit (LEO), roughly 160 to 2,000 km above the Earth's surface, where many manned spacecraft like the International Space Station (ISS) orbit.

3. **Size and appearance of the Great Wall**: The Great Wall is very long (thousands of kilometers), but it's also quite narrow, typically a few meters wide. It is made from materials that roughly match the color and texture of the surrounding terrain.

4. **Visibility with naked eye**: To be visible to the naked eye from space, an object must be large enough and have enough contrast from the surrounding environment to be distinguishable without optical aids.

5. **Astronaut reports and research**: According to astronauts and scientific evidence:
   - The Great Wall is **not easily visible** from low Earth orbit with the naked eye.
   - It blends into the natural landscapes around it.
   - Other man-made structures, like cities or airports, are more easily visible due to contrasting colors and larger surface areas.
   - Under particular conditions (good lighting, favorable weather, clear skies), some people have reported spotting the Wall, but this is difficult and not guaranteed.

6. **Official stance**: NASA and other space agencies have confirmed that the Great Wall cannot be reliably seen by the naked eye from space.

**Conclusion**: The Great Wall of China is generally **not visible from space with the naked eye** due to its narrow width and how well it blends into the surroundings, despite its great length.

**Final Answer**: No, the Great Wall of China is not visible from space with the naked eye.",No
verify,B,Is sound a form of energy?,"Let's analyze the question step by step:

1. **Definition of Sound:**  
   Sound is a type of wave that travels through a medium (like air, water, or solids) by vibrating the particles in the medium.

2. **How Sound Travels:**  
   When an object vibrates, it causes the particles in the surrounding medium to vibrate as well. These vibrations propagate through the medium as longitudinal waves.

3. **Energy Transfer:**  
   Since sound involves the movement and vibration of particles, it transfers energy from one particle to another as the wave moves through the medium.

4. **Is Sound Energy?**  
   Energy is defined as the capacity to do work or cause change. Because sound waves cause particles in a medium to vibrate and transfer this energy through the medium, sound itself is a form of energy—specifically mechanical energy carried by a wave.

**Conclusion:**  
Yes, sound is a form of energy because it consists of mechanical vibrations that transfer energy through a medium.

**Final answer:**  
**Yes, sound is a form of energy.**",Yes
verify,B,Is lightning hotter than the surface of the Sun?,"Let's analyze the question step by step.

**Step 1: Understand the temperature of lightning.**  
- Lightning is a rapid discharge of electricity in the atmosphere.  
- The temperature of a lightning bolt can reach approximately 30,000 Kelvin (K) or about 53,540 degrees Fahrenheit (°F).  

**Step 2: Understand the temperature of the surface of the Sun.**  
- The Sun's surface, known as the photosphere, has an average temperature of about 5,500 Kelvin (5,500 K) or approximately 9,932 degrees Fahrenheit (°F).  

**Step 3: Compare the temperatures.**  
- Lightning: ~30,000 K  
- Sun's surface: ~5,500 K  

Clearly, lightning is significantly hotter than the surface of the Sun.  

**Step 4: Additional consideration**  
- It's worth noting that although lightning is hotter, it lasts for a very short time and occupies a much smaller volume compared to the Sun's surface.  
- The Sun's core, much hotter than its surface, reaches about 15 million Kelvin, but the question specifically asks about the surface.  

**Final answer:**  
Yes, lightning is hotter than the surface of the Sun.",Yes
verify,B,Is a tomato biologically classified as a fruit?,"Let's reason through this step by step:

1. **Botanical Definition of a Fruit**:  
   In biology, a fruit is the mature ovary of a flowering plant, usually containing seeds. Fruits develop from the fertilized ovules of the flower.

2. **What is a Tomato?**  
   A tomato develops from the ovary of the tomato flower and contains seeds inside.

3. **Does the Tomato Fit the Botanical Definition of a Fruit?**  
   Since tomatoes develop from the flower’s ovary and contain seeds, they meet the botanical criteria for a fruit.

4. **Common Misconceptions**:

verify,C,Is Pluto currently classified as a planet by the IAU?,"Let's analyze the question step by step:

1. **What is the IAU?**  
   The IAU stands for the International Astronomical Union, which is the authority responsible for naming and classifying celestial bodies.

2. **Historical background on Pluto's classification:**  
   - Pluto was discovered in 1930 and was classified as the ninth planet of our Solar System for many decades.  
   - In 2006, the IAU redefined the criteria for what constitutes a planet.

3. **The IAU's 2006 definition of a planet:**  
   A celestial body must meet three criteria to be classified as a planet in the Solar System:  
   - It must orbit the Sun.  
   - It must be spherical in shape due to its own gravity.  
   - It must have cleared its orbit of other debris.

4. **Pluto's status under the new definition:**  
   Pluto meets the first two criteria (orbits the Sun and is spherical). However, it does **not** meet the third criterion because it shares its orbital zone with other objects in the Kuiper Belt.

5. **Resulting classification:**  
   Because Pluto does not satisfy all three criteria, the IAU reclassified it as a ""dwarf planet,"" not a planet.

**Final conclusion:**  
No, **Pluto is currently not classified as a planet by the IAU**; it is classified as a dwarf planet.",No
verify,C,Is a whale biologically classified as a fish?,"Let's analyze the question step by step:

1. **Definition of Fish**: Fish are aquatic animals that typically have gills throughout their lives, lack limbs with digits, and generally have scales. They belong to the paraphyletic group typically characterized by these features.

2. **Characteristics of a Whale**:
   - Whales are warm-blooded (endothermic), unlike most fish which are cold-blooded (ectothermic).
   - Whales are mammals, meaning they breathe air using lungs, not gills.
   - Whales give birth to live young and nurse them with milk from mammary glands.
   - Whales have lungs and breathe air through blowholes.
   - Whales have hair, at least at some stage of development, which fish lack.

3. **Biological Classification**:
   - Whales belong to the class Mammalia.
   - Fish generally belong to groups such as cartilaginous fish (class Chondrichthyes) and bony fish (class Actinopterygii).
   - Whales are more closely related to land mammals than to fish.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - Despite living in water and their fish-like shape, whales are not fish.
   - They are mammals and share key biological traits with other mammals.

**Final Answer**: No, a whale is not biologically classified as a fish; it is a mammal.",No
verify,C,Does sound require a medium to travel?,"Let's analyze the question step by step:

1. **What is sound?**  
   Sound is a mechanical wave that propagates through the vibration of particles in a medium.

2. **How does sound travel?**  
   Sound waves travel by causing particles in a medium (solid, liquid, or gas) to vibrate. These vibrations propagate from one particle to the next, transferring energy through the medium.

3. **Does sound travel in a vacuum?**  
   Since a vacuum has no particles, there are no particles to vibrate or transfer the sound energy. Therefore, sound cannot travel through a vacuum.

4. **Examples**:  
   - Sound travels through air (a gas), water (a liquid), and solids like metal.  
   - In space (a near-perfect vacuum), sound cannot travel because there is no medium.

**Conclusion:**  
Yes, sound requires a medium to travel. Without a medium, such as in a vacuum, sound cannot propagate.

**Final answer:**  
Sound requires a medium (solid, liquid, or gas) to travel and cannot travel through a vacuum.",Yes
verify,C,Is glass technically a supercooled liquid?,"Let's analyze the question step by step:

**Question:** Is glass technically a supercooled liquid?

---

### Step 1: Define what a supercooled liquid is

- A **supercooled liquid** is a liquid that is cooled below its freezing point without becoming a solid. It remains in a metastable liquid state because crystallization is avoided.

### Step 2: Understand the nature of glass

- Glass is an **amorphous solid**, meaning its atoms do not have the regular, repeating lattice structure characteristic of crystalline solids.
- When a liquid cools and does *not* crystallize, it can form this amorphous solid — glass — through a process called **vitrification**.

### Step 3: Examine if glass behaves like a liquid or solid

- Glass behaves mechanically like a solid at everyday time scales. It maintains its shape and does not flow like a liquid.
- However, some older theories suggested glass is a ""supercooled liquid"" with extremely high viscosity, implying it flows very slowly.
- Modern understanding shows **glass is a solid**, but it has a disordered atomic structure similar to that of a liquid, *frozen* in place.

### Step 4: Clarify the misconception about glass flowing over long times (e.g., old windows)

- Sometimes people say old glass windows are thicker at the bottom because glass flows over centuries.
- This is a myth; scientific measurements show glass does not flow at room temperature over observable timescales.
- The thickness variation is due to old manufacturing methods, not flow.

---

### Final conclusion

- Glass is *not* technically a supercooled liquid.
- It is an **amorphous solid** formed when a liquid is cooled sufficiently fast to avoid crystallization.
- It has a rigid structure like a solid but with a disordered atomic arrangement.

---

**Answer:**

No, glass is not technically a supercooled liquid. Glass is an amorphous solid that has a disordered atomic structure like a liquid frozen in place, but it behaves mechanically like a solid and does not flow like a liquid.",No
verify,C,Is time dilation predicted by Einstein’s theory of relativity?,"Let's analyze the question step by step:

1. **Understanding time dilation:**  
   Time dilation refers to the phenomenon where time passes at different rates for observers in different frames of reference. Specifically, a clock moving relative to an observer or in a stronger gravitational field will appear to tick more slowly compared to a clock at rest with respect to that observer or in a weaker gravitational field.

2. **Relativity and its types:**  
   Einstein's theory of relativity consists of two parts:
   - **Special relativity**: Deals with the physics of objects moving at constant speeds, especially close to the speed of light, and the relationship between space and time in inertial frames.
   - **General relativity**: Extends special relativity to include gravity, explaining how mass and energy curve spacetime.

3. **Time dilation in special relativity:**  
   Special relativity predicts that a moving clock will be measured by a stationary observer to run slower than a clock at rest with respect to that observer. This is called **kinematic time dilation** and arises from the relative motion of observers.

4. **Time dilation in general relativity:**  
   General relativity predicts another kind of time dilation — **gravitational time dilation**. Clocks closer to massive objects (in stronger gravitational fields) run slower compared to clocks farther away in weaker gravitational fields.

5. **Conclusion:**  
   Both parts of Einstein’s theories of relativity predict time dilation, though the causes differ (relative velocity in special relativity and gravitational field strength in general relativity).

**Final answer:**

Yes, time dilation is predicted by Einstein's theory of relativity, both in special relativity (due to relative motion) and general relativity (due to gravity).",Yes
verify,C,Is electricity the flow of protons?,"Let's analyze the question carefully and step by step.

### Question: Is electricity the flow of protons?

**Step 1: Understanding electricity**  
Electricity, in most common contexts, refers to the movement of electric charge. This flow of electric charge can occur in different forms depending on the medium.

**Step 2: What particles carry electric charge?**  
- **Electrons:** Negatively charged particles found in atoms.  
- **Protons:** Positively charged particles found in atomic nuclei.  
- **Ions:** Atoms or molecules that have gained or lost electrons, becoming charged.

**Step 3: Typical charge carriers in electricity**  
- In **metallic conductors** (like copper wires), the charge carriers are **electrons**. These electrons flow through the lattice of metal atoms, creating an electric current. Protons in the nuclei are bound tightly and do not move.  
- In **electrolytes and plasmas**, both positive and negative ions can move, contributing to current. The positive ions are often protons (H⁺) or other positive ions, but they move in solution or plasma, not in solid conductors.

**Step 4: Are protons the carriers of electrical current?**  
- In a common electric circuit with metal wires, **no**, protons do not flow because they are part of the atomic nuclei and are fixed in position within the solid lattice.  
- In other systems like in biological systems (nerve conduction) or in electrolytes (like inside a battery), positively charged ions, sometimes including free protons (H⁺), can carry charge by moving through the solution. In these contexts, positive charge flow can be carried by protons or other ions. But this is not the same as electricity flowing through wires.

**Step 5: Conclusion**  
Electricity is generally the flow of **electrons**, not protons, especially in metal conductors. Protons do not flow in these cases because they are tightly bound in nuclei. However, in some specialized situations (like in electrolytes), positively charged ions including protons can move and conduct charge, but this is not the typical flow of electricity referred to in circuits.

---

### Final Answer:
No, electricity is not the flow of protons. In most common cases, electricity is the flow of electrons. Protons are bound within the nuclei of atoms and do not move in conductive materials.",No
verify,C,Is absolute zero equal to 0°C?,"Let's analyze the question step by step.

**Question:** Is absolute zero equal to 0°C?

**Step 1: Understand what absolute zero means.**  
Absolute zero is the theoretical temperature at which particles have minimal thermal motion, representing the lowest possible temperature. It is the zero point on the Kelvin scale (0 K).

**Step 2: Understand the Celsius scale.**  
The Celsius scale sets the freezing point of water at 0°C and the boiling point of water at 100°C at standard atmospheric pressure.

**Step 3: Convert absolute zero to Celsius.**  
The conversion between Kelvin (K) and Celsius (°C) is given by:  
\[ T(°C) = T(K) - 273.15 \]

Since absolute zero is 0 K, plugging this in:  
\[ 0 K - 273.15 = -273.15°C \]

**Step 4: Compare the values.**  
Absolute zero is -273.15°C, *not* 0°C.

**Answer:**  
No, absolute zero is not equal to 0°C. Absolute zero is approximately -273.15°C.",No
verify,C,Is human blood always red?,"Let's think step by step:

1. **Common understanding:** Human blood is generally described as red. This is true for blood in the body and blood exposed to oxygen (like when you get a cut).

2. **Why is blood red?** Human blood contains hemoglobin, a protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen. Hemoglobin has iron which binds to oxygen and gives oxygenated blood a bright red color.

3. **Is all human blood red?** Inside the body, not all blood appears bright red:
   - **Oxygenated blood:** When blood is rich in oxygen (like in arteries), it is bright red.
   - **Deoxygenated blood:** When blood has less oxygen (like in veins), it is a darker red or maroon, but still red.

4. **Is there any case where blood is not red?** 
   - In humans, blood is always some shade of red because of hemoglobin.
   - Some animals have differently colored blood due to different oxygen-carrying molecules (like hemocyanin in some mollusks and arthropods, which is blue), but humans do not have that.

5. **Are there exceptions or special conditions?** 
   - Rare medical conditions can alter blood color slightly due to abnormal hemoglobin forms or blood components, but even then, blood remains within a spectrum of red hues.
   - Inside the body, because of lighting and tissue, blood might not be perceived as red directly, but physically, it is red.

**Conclusion:** Human blood is always some shade of red due to hemoglobin, regardless of oxygenation state. It is never another color.

**Final answer:** Yes, human blood is always red.",Yes
verify,C,Is gravity considered a force in general relativity?,"Let's analyze the question step by step:

1. **Gravity in Newtonian physics**:  
   In classical Newtonian mechanics, gravity is indeed considered a force. It acts instantaneously at a distance, pulling objects with a force proportional to their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them (Newton's law of universal gravitation).

2. **Shift in conceptual framework with General Relativity (GR)**:  
   Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity, formulated in 1915, fundamentally changes the way gravity is understood. Instead of being treated as a force, gravity is explained as the effect of spacetime curvature caused by mass-energy.

3. **Spacetime and geodesics**:  
   In GR, massive objects cause the geometry of spacetime to curve. Other objects moving under the influence of gravity follow the straightest possible paths (called geodesics) in this curved spacetime. These paths appear as if the objects are ""falling"" due to a force, but in fact, they are moving along geodesics determined by the geometry of spacetime.

4. **Summarizing the conceptual difference**:  
   - In Newtonian physics: Gravity = a force acting at a distance.  
   - In General Relativity: Gravity ≠ a force; it is a manifestation of curved spacetime geometry.

5. **Does GR ""consider gravity a force""?**  
   Formally and fundamentally, no. GR replaces the concept of a gravitational force with the concept of curved spacetime guiding the motion of ""freely falling"" objects.

**Final answer:**  
In general relativity, gravity is **not** considered a force. Instead, it is understood as the curvature of spacetime caused by mass and energy, and objects move along geodesics in this curved spacetime rather than being acted upon by a force.",No
verify,C,Is light affected by gravity?,"Let's analyze the question step by step to ensure a thorough and consistent understanding:

1. **Understanding the question:**  
   The question asks whether light is affected by gravity. Light consists of photons, which are massless particles. Gravity, in classical Newtonian physics, is the force between masses. Since photons have no rest mass, one might initially think gravity would not affect light.

2. **Classical Newtonian view:**  
   - Gravity is a force between masses.  
   - Since photons have zero rest mass, classical physics suggests no gravitational attraction to light.  
   - This leads to the assumption: light should not be affected by gravity under Newtonian mechanics.

3. **Modern understanding (General Relativity):**  
   - Einstein's theory of General Relativity (GR) describes gravity not as a force but as curvature of spacetime caused by mass and energy.  
   - Light follows the straightest possible paths (called geodesics) through curved spacetime.  
   - Therefore, light's trajectory is influenced when it passes near massive bodies because the spacetime geometry around such masses is curved.

4. **Empirical evidence:**  
   - Gravitational lensing: Strong evidence that light bends when passing near massive objects such as galaxies or black holes.  
   - The bending of starlight by the Sun observed during solar eclipses matches GR’s predictions.  
   - This confirms that light is affected by gravity, despite having no mass.

5. **Additional considerations:**  
   - Although photons have energy, and via E=mc² energy relates to mass, GR tells us gravity couples to energy and momentum, not just rest mass.  
   - Light’s energy contributes to and reacts to gravitational fields.

**Final conclusion:**  
Yes, light is affected by gravity. While light has no rest mass, General Relativity predicts and observations confirm that the path of light is influenced by the curvature of spacetime caused by mass and energy.

**Answer:**  
**Yes, light is affected by gravity.**",Yes
verify,D,Is Mount Everest the tallest mountain measured from Earth’s center?,"Let's analyze the question carefully step by step:

1. **Common understanding of ""tallest mountain""**:  
   Mount Everest is widely recognized as the tallest mountain above sea level, with a peak elevation of about 8,848 meters (29,029 feet).

2. **Measuring from Earth's center vs sea level**:  
   The usual measurement of a mountain's height uses sea level as the baseline. However, measuring from Earth's center (the geocentric height) is a different approach.

3. **Earth's shape affects measurements**:  
   Earth is not a perfect sphere; it is an oblate spheroid—bulging at the equator due to its rotation. This means the Earth's radius at the equator is larger than at the poles.

4. **Mount Everest's location**:  
   Mount Everest is located in the Himalayas, at about 28 degrees north latitude, relatively far from the equator.

5. **Mount Chimborazo's location**:  
   Mount Chimborazo in Ecuador is closer to the equator (about 1 degree south latitude).

6. **Comparing heights from Earth's center**:  
   Although Mount Chimborazo is lower relative to sea level (~6,263 meters), because it is situated near the equator where Earth's radius bulges, its summit is actually the farthest point from Earth's center.

**Conclusion:**  
- Mount Everest is the tallest mountain above sea level.  
- Mount Chimborazo is the mountain whose summit is farthest from the center of the Earth.

**Final Answer:**  
No, Mount Everest is not the tallest mountain measured from Earth’s center; that distinction belongs to Mount Chimborazo due to its location near the equator where Earth's radius is greatest.",No
verify,D,Is a bat blind?,"Step 1: Understand the question.
The question ""Is a bat blind?"" is asking whether bats lack the ability to see.

Step 2: Recall common knowledge or facts about bats.
There is a common myth that bats are blind, but this is not accurate. Bats have eyes and can see, although their vision varies depending on the species.

Step 3: Consider how bats navigate.
Bats are well-known for using echolocation to navigate and find food in the dark. They emit high-frequency sounds and listen to the echoes that bounce off objects, which helps them ""see"" their surroundings via sound. This ability is often mistaken as meaning they must be blind.

Step 4: Verify the myth versus reality.
- Bats have functioning eyes and can see.
- Their eyesight is generally adapted for low light conditions.
- Echolocation supplements their vision but does not replace it.
- Hence, bats are not blind.

Final answer:
No, bats are not blind. They have eyes and can see, but they also use echolocation to navigate and hunt in the dark.",No
verify,D,Is a tomato a vegetable according to botany?,"Let's analyze the question step by step:

1. **Common Usage vs. Botanical Definition**:
   - In everyday language and cooking, tomatoes are often treated as vegetables because they are used in savory dishes.
   - However, botanical classification is based on the plant's reproductive structures and development rather than culinary usage.

2. **Botanical Classification**:
   - Botanically, a fruit is the mature ovary of a flowering plant, usually containing seeds.
   - A vegetable is any other part of the plant such as roots, stems, leaves, or flowers.

3. **Tomato Characteristics**:
   - Tomatoes develop from the fertilized ovary in the flower of the tomato plant.
   - They contain seeds inside the fleshy part.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - Since tomatoes develop from the ovary of a flower and contain seeds, they fit the botanical definition of a fruit.
   - Therefore, botanically speaking, a tomato is a fruit, not a vegetable.

**Final Answer:**  
According to botany, a tomato is a fruit, not a vegetable.",No
verify,D,Is the brain the largest organ in the human body?,"Let's analyze the question step by step:

1. **Definition of an organ:**  
   An organ is a part of the body that performs a specific function or group of functions. Examples include the heart, liver, skin, lungs, and brain.

2. **What is the largest organ in the human body?**  
   Typically, the **skin** is considered the largest organ because it covers the entire body and serves multiple critical functions such as protection, temperature regulation, and sensation.

3. **Size comparison of the brain:**  
   The brain is a very large and complex organ, weighing about 1.3 to 1.4 kilograms in an average adult. It is one of the largest organs inside the body but is much smaller in terms of surface area and weight compared to the skin.

4. **Conclusion:**  
   Although the brain is a very important organ and one of the largest internal organs, **it is not the largest organ overall in the human body**. The largest organ is the skin.

**Final Answer:**  
No, the brain is not the largest organ in the human body. The largest organ is the skin.",No
verify,D,Is DNA visible to the naked eye?,"Let's analyze the question step-by-step:

1. **What is DNA?**  
   DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) is a molecule that carries genetic information in living organisms.

2. **Size of DNA molecules:**  
   DNA molecules are extremely small, on the order of nanometers (one-billionth of a meter) in diameter. A single DNA strand is about 2 nanometers wide.

3. **Visibility to the naked eye:**  
   The human eye can generally see objects down to about 0.1 millimeters (100 micrometers) in size under good conditions, which is about 50,000 times larger than the width of a DNA molecule.

4. **DNA in bulk:**  
   While individual DNA molecules are too small to see, a clump or pellet of many DNA molecules (such as DNA extracted and precipitated in a lab) can be visible as a white, thread-like or clumpy substance.

**Conclusion:**  
- Individual DNA molecules are **not visible** to the naked eye.  
- Large quantities of DNA, aggregated together, **can be seen** as a mass.

**Final answer:**  
Individual DNA molecules are invisible to the naked eye, but bulk DNA in a sufficiently large quantity can be seen as a whitish clump.",No
verify,D,Is the color white the absence of light?,"Let's analyze the question step by step:

1. **What is color in terms of light?**  
   Color is perceived based on the wavelengths of light that are reflected or emitted by an object and detected by our eyes. Different wavelengths correspond to different colors.

2. **What does ""white"" color mean in terms of light?**  
   White light is generally a combination of all visible wavelengths of light mixed together. When all the colors of the spectrum (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet) are combined, the resulting light appears white to our eyes.

3. **What does ""absence of light"" mean?**  
   Absence of light means there are no photons of visible light reaching the eyes. This corresponds to ""black"" rather than white. Black is perceived when an object absorbs all visible light and reflects none, or when there is no light present.

4. **Conclusion:**  
   White is not the absence of light. In fact, white is the presence of all visible wavelengths of light combined. The absence of light is perceived as black.

**Final answer:**  
**No, the color white is not the absence of light. White is the presence of all visible wavelengths of light combined.**",No
verify,D,Is sound louder in space than on Earth?,"Let's analyze this question step by step.

1. **What is sound?**  
   Sound is a mechanical wave that travels through a medium (such as air, water, or solid materials) by vibrating the particles in that medium.

2. **How does sound travel?**  
   Sound waves need a medium through which to propagate. They travel by causing particles in the medium (air molecules, water molecules, etc.) to vibrate and transfer the sound energy along.

3. **What about space?**  
   Space (outer space) is a near-vacuum, meaning it has extremely few particles or atoms per volume. There is no substantial medium like air or water for the sound waves to travel through.

4. **Implications for sound in space:**  
   Since sound requires a medium and space essentially lacks this medium, sound waves cannot propagate there. As a result, no sound can be heard in space regardless of its volume or source.

5. **Comparison of loudness:**  
   On Earth, sound waves travel through the air, and their loudness depends on the amplitude of the waves and the medium’s properties. In space, since no sound can propagate, it would be effectively silent.

**Conclusion:**  
Sound is not louder in space. In fact, there is no sound at all in space because there is no medium to carry the sound waves. Therefore, the question ""Is sound louder in space than on Earth?"" is answered with **No** — sound cannot be heard in space.

**Final answer:**  
Sound is not louder in space; it cannot travel there at all, so space is effectively silent compared to Earth.",No

1. The claim is that the Great Wall of China is the **only** man-made object visible from space.

2. First, define ""visible from space."" Generally, this means that the object can be seen with the naked eye from orbit, which is roughly 160 to 2,000 kilometers (100 to 1,240 miles) above Earth.

3. The Great Wall of China is long but relatively narrow, only a few meters wide. This makes it difficult to see with the naked eye from space.

4. Astronauts and experts have reported that the Great Wall is *not* easily visible from low Earth orbit without aid, due to its narrow width and the color blending with the surrounding terrain.

5. Other man-made structures such as cities, airports, highways, large dams, and airports are clearly visible from space due to their contrast with natural features and larger scale.

6. Large developments such as city lights at night or major man-made islands are also visible from space.

**Conclusion:**

- The Great Wall of China is **not** the only man-made object visible from space.
- In fact, many man-made objects can be seen from space, depending on conditions like lighting and the observer's equipment.
- The idea that the Great Wall is the only visible man-made object from space is a common myth.

**Final answer:**  
No, the Great Wall of China is not the only man-made object visible from space. Many other man-made structures, such as cities and highways, can be seen from space under the right conditions.",No
verify,D,Is lightning always hotter than lava?,"Let's analyze the question step by step:

1. **Understanding the question:**  
   We need to determine if lightning is **always** hotter than lava. That is, in every case, does the temperature of lightning exceed the temperature of lava?

2. **Typical temperature of lightning:**  
   - Lightning can reach temperatures of around **30,000 Kelvin (K)** or about **54,000 degrees Fahrenheit (°F)**.
   - This extremely high temperature is caused by the rapid discharge of electricity.

3. **Typical temperature of lava:**  
   - Lava temperature varies depending on the type of lava but typically ranges from about **700 to 1,200 degrees Celsius (°C)**.
   - In Fahrenheit, that is approximately **1,300 to 2,200 degrees Fahrenheit (°F)**.

verify,D,Is water always liquid at 25°C?,"Let's analyze the question: ""Is water always liquid at 25°C?""

### Step 1: Understand the question
The question asks whether water is **always** in the liquid state at a temperature of 25°C (room temperature).

### Step 2: Recall typical behavior of water
- Water at standard atmospheric pressure (1 atm) has a melting point of 0°C and a boiling point of 100°C.
- At 25°C, water is usually found in the liquid state under normal pressure.

### Step 3: Consider the effect of pressure
- The state of water depends not only on temperature but also on pressure.
- If the pressure is significantly lower than 1 atm (for example, in a vacuum), water can boil at temperatures much lower than 100°C. So at 25°C and very low pressure, water could be gaseous.
- If the pressure is very high, water could be in different phases (such as ice phases that exist at high pressure and temperatures above 0°C but below critical temperature).

### Step 4: Consider other influences and conditions
- At 25°C and standard pressure, water is definitely liquid.
- But if pressure is changed drastically or if water contains impurities or is under special conditions (like in a laboratory under vacuum or high pressure), it may not be liquid.
- For example, water vapor (gas) can exist at 25°C if the pressure is low enough.
- Similarly, ice can exist above 0°C at very high pressures (ice phases like Ice VI or Ice VII).

### Step 5: Conclusion
Water is **not always liquid at 25°C**. Its phase depends on both temperature and pressure. While at standard atmospheric pressure water is liquid at 25°C, changing pressure can change its phase.

---

### Final answer:
No, water is not always liquid at 25°C. The phase of water at 25°C depends on the pressure; it is liquid at standard atmospheric pressure, but can be gas at low pressure or certain types of solid ice at high pressures.",No

2. **Temperature of the Surface of the Sun**:  
   The surface of the Sun, which is called the photosphere, has a temperature of about **5,800 Kelvin (K)** or roughly **9,940 degrees Fahrenheit (°F)**.

3. **Comparison**:  
   - Lightning temperature: ~30,000 K  
   - Sun’s surface temperature: ~5,800 K

4. **Conclusion**:  
   Since 30,000 K > 5,800 K, **lightning is significantly hotter than the surface of the Sun**.

**Final Answer:**  
Yes, lightning is hotter than the surface of the Sun by a substantial margin.",Yes
verify,E,Did Cleopatra live closer in time to the Moon landing than to the construction of the pyramids?,"Let's analyze the time periods involved step by step:

1. **When did Cleopatra live?**
   - Cleopatra VII ruled Egypt from 51 BC to 30 BC.

2. **When were the Egyptian pyramids built?**
   - The Great Pyramid of Giza was constructed around 2580–2560 BC.

3. **When was the Moon landing?**
   - The Apollo 11 Moon landing occurred in 1969 AD.

---

### Calculate the time differences:

**Time between Cleopatra and the pyramids:**
- Cleopatra lived around 30 BC.
- The pyramids were built around 2560 BC.
- Difference in years = 2560 - 30 = 2530 years.

**Time between Cleopatra and the Moon landing:**
- Cleopatra lived around 30 BC.
- The Moon landing happened in 1969 AD.
- Since there is no year 0, from 30 BC to 1 BC is 29 years, from 1 AD to 1969 AD is 1968 years.
- Total difference = 30 + 1969 = 1999 years.

---

### Conclusion:

- Cleopatra lived about **2530 years after the pyramids** were built.
- Cleopatra lived about **1999 years before the Moon landing**.

Since 1999 years is less than 2530 years, Cleopatra lived closer in time to the Moon landing than to the construction of the pyramids.

verify,E,Can humans survive without a stomach?,"Let's analyze the question step by step:

1. **Function of the stomach:**  
   The stomach is a vital organ in the digestive system that breaks down food using stomach acid and enzymes, especially proteins. It also acts as a temporary storage for food, slowly releasing it into the small intestine for further digestion and nutrient absorption.

2. **Is the stomach essential for digestion?**  
   While the stomach plays a significant role in the digestion process, the small intestine is where most nutrient absorption occurs. The stomach helps in mechanical and chemical digestion but is not the only organ involved.

3. **What happens if the stomach is removed?**  
   A surgical procedure known as a gastrectomy involves removing part or all of the stomach, usually to treat cancer or severe ulcers. Patients can survive after a total gastrectomy; however, they usually require changes in diet and sometimes supplementation.

4. **Adaptations after stomach removal:**  
   - Food moves directly from the esophagus to the small intestine.  
   - Patients must eat smaller, more frequent meals because the stomach's storage capacity is lost.  
   - There may be malabsorption of certain nutrients, such as vitamin B12, iron, and calcium, requiring supplements.  
   - Medical monitoring and nutritional support are important.

5. **Real-world evidence:**  
   Many individuals have lived, sometimes for years, after complete stomach removal with proper medical care.

### Conclusion:  
Humans **can survive without a stomach**, but it requires medical intervention, dietary adjustments, and often supplementation to maintain health and proper nutrition.

**Final answer: Yes, humans can survive without a stomach if they receive appropriate medical and nutritional care.**",Yes
verify,E,Is sound able to travel faster in water than in air?,"Let's analyze this question step by step.

1. **What is sound?**  
   Sound is a mechanical wave that travels through a medium by the vibration of particles in that medium.

2. **What affects the speed of sound?**  
   The speed of sound depends on the medium's properties, primarily its density and elasticity (or bulk modulus).

3. **Comparison of air and water properties:**
   - **Air:** Less dense and less elastic compared to water. The speed of sound in air at room temperature (about 20°C) is approximately 343 meters per second.
   - **Water:** Much denser but also much more incompressible (higher bulk modulus) than air. This means water resists compression more strongly, which significantly affects how sound travels.

4. **How does elasticity affect sound speed?**  
   A more elastic (less compressible) medium allows sound to travel faster because the particles return to their original position more quickly after being disturbed.

5. **Practical speeds:**
   - Speed of sound in air ≈ 343 m/s  
   - Speed of sound in water ≈ 1482 m/s (about 4.3 times faster than in air)

6. **Reasoning check:**
   Although water is denser than air (which could slow sound down), the much higher elasticity outweighs the density effect, resulting in faster sound travel.

**Final answer:**  
Yes, sound travels faster in water than in air.",Yes

verify,E,Do humans generally use only 10% of their brains?,"Let's analyze the claim step by step:

1. **Common Saying**: The idea that humans use only 10% of their brains is a popular myth often repeated in media and self-help contexts.

2. **Brain Imaging Studies**: Modern neuroscience uses tools like fMRI and PET scans to observe brain activity. These studies show that almost all parts of the brain have some kind of function and are active at various times.

3. **Brain Damage Evidence**: Damage to almost any part of the brain can lead to deficits in cognition, movement, sensation, or emotion. This indicates that all regions have important functions.

4. **Energy Consumption**: The brain uses about 20% of the body’s energy. It’s unlikely that evolution would support such a metabolically expensive organ if 90% of it were unused.

5. **Neuroscientific Consensus**: Experts agree that humans use essentially all parts of their brains, although not always all at once. Different parts are active for different tasks.

**Final Conclusion**: The claim that humans use only 10% of their brains is false. Humans use virtually all parts of their brain, though not all simultaneously. The 10% figure is a myth without scientific basis.",No
verify,E,Can HIV be transmitted through casual contact such as hugging or sharing utensils?,"Let's analyze the question step-by-step to ensure a clear and accurate answer.

**Question:** Can HIV be transmitted through casual contact such as hugging or sharing utensils?

### Step 1: Understand what HIV is
HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) is a virus that attacks the body's immune system and can lead to AIDS if untreated.

### Step 2: Understand the modes of HIV transmission
HIV is primarily transmitted through specific body fluids:
- Blood
- Semen
- Vaginal fluids
- Rectal fluids
- Breast milk

The virus enters the bloodstream through mucous membranes or direct injection (such as through needles).

### Step 3: Look at casual contact scenarios
- **Hugging:** This involves skin-to-skin contact, without exchange of blood or other bodily fluids listed above. Skin is an effective barrier against HIV.
- **Sharing utensils:** This might involve saliva transfer, but saliva does not contain enough HIV to transmit the virus under normal conditions.

### Step 4: Conclusion from scientific evidence
- HIV is **not transmitted** via hugging, casual touch, or sharing food and utensils.
- Transmission requires specific exposure to infected fluids through mucous membranes, deep wounds, or direct blood-to-blood contact.

### Final answer:
No, HIV cannot be transmitted through casual contact such as hugging or sharing utensils. HIV transmission requires specific types of exposure involving certain bodily fluids.",No
verify,E,Were ancient Greek and Roman statues originally pure white?,"This is a common question with some misconceptions, so let's analyze it step by step.

1. **Common Belief:**  
   Many people believe that ancient Greek and Roman statues were originally pure white marble, as they often see them today in museums or photographs.

2. **Reality of Original Appearance:**  
   Scholars and scientific analyses have shown that many ancient statues were originally painted in bright colors—a practice called **polychromy**. The paint has worn off over time due to weathering, cleaning, and aging, leaving behind the bare marble which appears white.

3. **Evidence:**

verify,F,Is the repeating decimal 3.484848… exactly equal to the fraction 115/33?,"Let's analyze whether the repeating decimal \(3.484848\ldots\) is exactly equal to the fraction \(\frac{115}{33}\).

---

### Step 1: Convert the repeating decimal to a fraction

The repeating decimal is \(3.484848\ldots\). Let's represent it as:

\[
x = 3.484848\ldots
\]

The repeating block is ""48"", which has 2 digits.

Multiply \(x\) by 100 to shift the decimal point two places to the right:

\[
100x = 348.484848\ldots
\]

Now subtract the original \(x\) from this:

\[
100x - x = 348.484848\ldots - 3.484848\ldots
\]
\[
99x = 345
\]

Divide both sides by 99:

\[
x = \frac{345}{99}
\]

Simplify the fraction:

- Both numerator and denominator are divisible by 3:
\[
\frac{345}{99} = \frac{345 \div 3}{99 \div 3} = \frac{115}{33}
\]

---

### Step 2: Answer the question

The fraction equivalent of the repeating decimal \(3.484848\ldots\) is \(\frac{115}{33}\).

### **Final answer:**

**Yes**, the repeating decimal \(3.484848\ldots\) is exactly equal to the fraction \(\frac{115}{33}\).",Yes
verify,F,"Using the alternating series estimation theorem, is n = 9 sufficient to guarantee an error less than 1/1000?","Let's analyze the problem step by step.

---

### Given:
- We want to use the **alternating series estimation theorem**.
- We are asked if **n = 9** terms are sufficient to guarantee an error less than **\(\frac{1}{1000} = 0.001\)**.

---

### Step 1: Understand the Alternating Series Estimation Theorem

The theorem states:  
For an alternating series \(\sum (-1)^k b_k\) with \(b_k\) positive, decreasing, and \(\lim_{k \to \infty} b_k = 0\), the error after summing \(n\) terms is at most the magnitude of the next term:

\[
|R_n| = \left| S - S_n \right| \leq b_{n+1}
\]

Therefore, to guarantee the error is less than 0.001, we need:

\[
b_{n+1} < 0.001
\]

---

### Step 2: Identify the \(b_k\) term for your series

Since the problem doesn't provide a specific series, let's consider the general approach:

- Typically, \(b_k\) is the absolute value of the \(k\)-th term of the series excluding the alternating sign.
- For example, if the series is something like:

\[
\sum_{k=1}^\infty (-1)^{k+1} \frac{1}{k^p}
\]

then

\[
b_k = \frac{1}{k^p}
\]

---

### Step 3: Check if \(b_{10} < 0.001\) when \(n = 9\)

- We must evaluate or estimate the 10th term \(b_{10}\) and check if it is less than 0.001.

For example, if the series is \(\sum (-1)^{k+1} \frac{1}{k}\), then:

\[
b_{10} = \frac{1}{10} = 0.1
\]

which is NOT less than 0.001.

If the series is \(\sum (-1)^{k+1} \frac{1}{k^2}\), then:

\[
b_{10} = \frac{1}{10^2} = \frac{1}{100} = 0.01
\]

which is still NOT less than 0.001.

If the series is \(\sum (-1)^{k+1} \frac{1}{k^3}\), then:

\[
b_{10} = \frac{1}{10^3} = \frac{1}{1000} = 0.001
\]

Exactly 0.001, not **less than** 0.001.

To guarantee the error is *less* than 0.001, you'd need a term \(b_{n+1}\) strictly less than 0.001.

---

### Step 4: Conclusion

- Without the explicit sequence \(b_k\), you **check \(b_{n+1}\)** whether it is **less than the desired error tolerance**.
- For **\(n=9\)**, if the **10th term \(b_{10} < 0.001\)**, then yes, the error is guaranteed to be less than 0.001.
- If \(b_{10} \geq 0.001\), then no, \(n=9\) terms are not enough to guarantee an error less than 0.001.

---

### **Final remarks:**

You need to apply this test specifically for your series’ term \(b_k\).

**If you provide the specific series or the general form of the terms, I can verify exactly whether \(n=9\) is sufficient or not.**",Yes
verify,F,"Given that the critical angle for water–air interface is approximately 48.75°, will a light ray traveling from water to air at 45° undergo total internal reflection?","Let's analyze the problem step by step.

### Given:
- Critical angle for water–air interface: approximately 48.75°
- Angle of incidence (in water): 45°

### Step 1: Understand what total internal reflection (TIR) means.
Total internal reflection occurs when:
- Light travels from a medium with higher refractive index to one with lower refractive index (water to air in this case).
- The angle of incidence is **greater than** the critical angle.

### Step 2: Compare the angle of incidence with the critical angle.
- Angle of incidence = 45°
- Critical angle = 48.75°

Since 45° < 48.75°, the angle of incidence is less than the critical angle.

### Step 3: Conclusion.
Because the angle of incidence is less than the critical angle, **total internal reflection will not occur**. Instead, part of the light will be refracted out into the air, and part may be reflected.

---

**Final answer:** No, the light ray traveling from water to air at 45° will **not** undergo total internal reflection.",No
verify,F,"If the absolute temperature of a light bulb filament is doubled, does its radiated power increase by a factor of 16 according to the Stefan–Boltzmann law?","Let's carefully analyze the problem step by step.

---

### Given:
- The absolute temperature of a filament, \( T \), is doubled.
- We want to see how the radiated power changes according to the **Stefan–Boltzmann law**.

### The Stefan–Boltzmann law states:
\[
P = \sigma A T^4
\]
where:
- \( P \) = total radiated power,
- \( \sigma \) = Stefan–Boltzmann constant,
- \( A \) = surface area of the radiating body,
- \( T \) = absolute temperature of the body (in Kelvin).

---

### Step 1: Understand the relationship between power and temperature
In the formula:
\[
P \propto T^4
\]
meaning power radiated is proportional to the fourth power of the absolute temperature.

---

### Step 2: Calculate the new power when temperature is doubled
Let the initial temperature be \( T \), then the initial power is:
\[
P_1 = \sigma A T^4
\]

When temperature is doubled, the new temperature:
\[
T_2 = 2T
\]

The new power radiated is:
\[
P_2 = \sigma A (2T)^4 = \sigma A (2^4) T^4 = \sigma A (16) T^4 = 16 \sigma A T^4 = 16 P_1
\]

---

### Step 3: Conclusion
Yes, when the absolute temperature of the filament is doubled, the radiated power **increases by a factor of 16** according to the Stefan–Boltzmann law.

---

### Final answer:
**Yes, the radiated power increases by a factor of 16 if the filament's absolute temperature is doubled.**",Yes
verify,F,"In a thin-lens camera model, is a magnification value of −0.002 physically plausible?","Let's analyze the question step by step:

### Given:
- A **thin-lens camera model** is being considered.
- Magnification \( M = -0.002 \).

---

### Step 1: Understanding magnification in thin-lens camera model

In the thin-lens equation and imaging system, magnification \( M \) is defined as:

\[
M = \frac{v}{u}
\]

where:
- \( v \) = image distance (distance from the lens to the image sensor/film),
- \( u \) = object distance (distance from the lens to the object),
- By convention, \( u > 0 \) for real objects in front of the lens,
- \( M \) is the ratio of image size to object size (linear magnification).

**Sign convention:**
- A **negative magnification** means the image is **inverted** relative to the object.
- A **positive magnification** means the image is upright.

---

### Step 2: Magnification magnitude

The magnitude \(|M|\) relates to the size change:

- If \(|M| > 1\), the image is larger than the object (magnified).
- If \(|M| < 1\), the image is smaller than the object (minified).
- If \(|M|\) is very small, the image is tiny compared to the object.

---

### Step 3: Is \(M = -0.002\) physically plausible?

- \( M = -0.002 \) means:
  - The image is inverted (due to negative sign),
  - The image size is 0.2% (0.002 times) the size of the object—extremely minified.

Let's check if such small magnification is plausible:

#### a) Typical magnitude values

- In cameras, the magnification varies depending on focusing distance and focal length.
- Objects far away produce very small magnifications because the image is tiny compared to object size.
- For example, if the object is very far (close to infinity), image size becomes very small — magnification approaches zero.
- \( |M| = 0.002 \) means the image is about 1/500 the size of the object. If the object is very far, this is reasonable.

#### b) Physical meaning in camera systems

- Cameras typically form real inverted images, so negative sign is expected.
- Tiny magnifications occur for distant scenes.
- Therefore, \( M = -0.002 \) is possible when photographing distant objects.

---

### Step 4: Consistency with lens formula

For a thin lens:

\[
\frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{u} + \frac{1}{v}
\]

and

\[
M = \frac{v}{u}
\]

Assume an object at distance \(u\) (real object, \(u > 0\)), lens focal length \(f\).

Given \( |M| \ll 1 \), this implies \( |v| \ll |u| \). Typical situation: For \(u\) large, \(v\) approaches \(f\).

If \(u \to \infty\):

\[
v \to f
\]

\[
M = \frac{v}{u} \to \frac{f}{\infty} = 0
\]

A tiny negative magnification of −0.002 is physically plausible for a real image of a far away object.

---

### **Final conclusion:**

- The sign **negative** indicates an inverted image, which is physically expected for real images formed by a thin convex lens.
- The magnitude \(0.002\) indicates an image size much smaller than the object size, which is plausible for very distant objects.
- Hence, a magnification value of \(-0.002\) is **physically plausible** in a thin-lens camera model.

verify,F,Are electromagnetic waves longitudinal waves?,"Let's analyze the question carefully and reason step by step.

**Question:** Are electromagnetic waves longitudinal waves?

---

### Step 1: Understanding wave types

- **Longitudinal waves:** In longitudinal waves, the particle displacement (vibration) is parallel to the direction of wave propagation. Examples include sound waves in air.
  
- **Transverse waves:** In transverse waves, the particle displacement is perpendicular to the direction of wave propagation. Examples include waves on a string or water waves on the surface.

---

### Step 2: Understanding electromagnetic waves

- Electromagnetic waves consist of oscillating electric and magnetic fields.
- The electromagnetic wave propagates through space, and the electric and magnetic fields oscillate **perpendicular** to each other and perpendicular to the direction of propagation.
- Because the oscillations of the fields are perpendicular to the direction of travel, electromagnetic waves are **transverse waves**.

---

### Step 3: Comparison and conclusion

- Since the oscillations of the electric and magnetic fields in an electromagnetic wave are perpendicular to the wave’s direction of propagation, electromagnetic waves are **not** longitudinal.
- Instead, they are transverse waves.

verify,F,"If a differentiable function f satisfies f(1)=5 and f'(x) ≤ 2 for all x, is the maximum possible value of f(4) equal to 11?","Let's analyze the problem step-by-step:

---

**Given:**
- \( f \) is differentiable.
- \( f(1) = 5 \).
- \( f'(x) \leq 2 \) for all \( x \).

**We want to check:**
Is the maximum possible value of \( f(4) \) equal to 11?

---

### Step 1: Understand the meaning of the derivative constraint
- The derivative \( f'(x) \leq 2 \) means the function's slope is never greater than 2 anywhere.
- Therefore, the function cannot increase faster than the slope of 2.

---

### Step 2: Use the Mean Value Theorem (MVT)
From \( f(1) = 5 \) to \( f(4) \), by MVT, there exists some \( c \in (1,4) \) such that

\[
f'(c) = \frac{f(4) - f(1)}{4 - 1} = \frac{f(4) - 5}{3}.
\]

Given that \( f'(x) \leq 2 \) for all \( x \),

\[
\frac{f(4) - 5}{3} = f'(c) \leq 2.
\]

---

### Step 3: Solve for \( f(4) \)

\[
\frac{f(4) - 5}{3} \leq 2 \implies f(4) - 5 \leq 6 \implies f(4) \leq 11.
\]

---

### Step 4: Determine if \( f(4) = 11 \) is achievable
- To achieve the maximum value 11, the slope must be the maximum allowed slope of 2 consistently from \( x=1 \) to \( x=4 \).
- For example, a linear function \( f(x) = 5 + 2(x - 1) \) has slope exactly 2 for all \( x \).
- For this function, \( f(4) = 5 + 2(3) = 11 \), which satisfies all conditions.

---

### **Conclusion**
- The maximum possible value of \( f(4) \) under the given conditions **is indeed 11**.
- This maximum can be actually achieved by a function with constant derivative equal to 2.

---

**Final answer:**

\[
\boxed{
\text{Yes, the maximum possible value of } f(4) \text{ is } 11.
}

verify,F,Does the derivative of the total cost function at 1000 units represent the average cost of producing the first 1000 units?,"Let's carefully analyze the question:

**Question:** Does the derivative of the total cost function at 1000 units represent the average cost of producing the first 1000 units?

---

### Step 1: Define the terms

- Let \( C(q) \) be the total cost function, where \( q \) is the quantity of units produced.
- The **average cost** of producing the first 1000 units is:
  \[
  \text{Average Cost up to } 1000 = \frac{C(1000)}{1000}
  \]
  This is the total cost for 1000 units divided by 1000.
  
- The **marginal cost** at 1000 units is the derivative of the total cost function at \( q = 1000 \):
  \[
  C'(1000) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{C(1000 + h) - C(1000)}{h}
  \]
  This represents the instantaneous rate of change of the total cost.

---

### Step 2: Interpret the derivative

The derivative \( C'(1000) \) represents the approximate cost of producing **one additional unit** precisely at the production level of 1000 units, i.e., the **marginal cost** at 1000 units.

---

### Step 3: Compare marginal cost with average cost

- The average cost \( \frac{C(1000)}{1000} \) is the total cost averaged over all 1000 units.
- The marginal cost \( C'(1000) \) is the *additional cost* of the 1001st unit.

These two generally **do not have the same value**.

- If the total cost function \( C(q) \) is linear, then marginal cost and average cost will be the same at all quantities.
- However, for nonlinear cost functions (which is typical), marginal and average cost differ.

---

### Step 4: Final conclusion

The derivative of the total cost function at 1000 units **does NOT** represent the average cost of producing the first 1000 units. Instead, it represents the marginal cost or approximate cost of producing one more unit just after 1000 units.

---

**Final answer:**

No, the derivative of the total cost function at 1000 units does not represent the average cost of producing the first 1000 units; it represents the marginal cost at 1000 units.",No
verify,F,"In a perfectly inelastic collision where a 10 g bullet embeds in a 1 kg block initially at rest, is the final speed equal to 1.00 m/s?","Let's analyze the problem step by step.

---

### Given:

- Mass of bullet, \( m_b = 10 \, \text{g} = 0.01 \, \text{kg} \)
- Mass of block, \( m_{\text{block}} = 1 \, \text{kg} \)
- Initial velocity of block, \( v_{\text{block, initial}} = 0 \, \text{m/s} \)
- The bullet embeds in the block (perfectly inelastic collision)
- We want to check if the final speed \( v_f \) is \( 1.00 \, \text{m/s} \).

---

### Step 1: Understand the physical scenario

The bullet collides with the block and sticks to it. In perfectly inelastic collisions, the two objects move together after collision.

---

### Step 2: Conservation of Momentum

Momentum before collision equals momentum after collision.

\[
p_{\text{initial}} = p_{\text{final}}
\]

Bullet initial momentum:

\[
p_b = m_b v_b
\]

Block initial momentum:

\[
p_{\text{block}} = m_{\text{block}} \times 0 = 0 \quad \text{(block is initially at rest)}
\]

Final momentum, both together moving at velocity \( v_f \):

\[
p_{\text{final}} = (m_b + m_{\text{block}}) v_f
\]

---

### Step 3: Write the momentum conservation equation

\[
m_b v_b + 0 = (m_b + m_{\text{block}}) v_f
\]

\[
v_f = \frac{m_b v_b}{m_b + m_{\text{block}}}
\]

---

### Step 4: Calculate or interpret what \( v_b \) (initial bullet velocity) must be for the given final velocity \( v_f = 1.00 \, \text{m/s} \)

Rearranged to find \( v_b \):

\[
v_b = \frac{(m_b + m_{\text{block}}) v_f}{m_b}
\]

Substitute given values:

\[
v_b = \frac{(0.01 + 1) \times 1.00}{0.01} = \frac{1.01}{0.01} = 101 \, \text{m/s}
\]

---

### Step 5: Interpretation

- For the final speed of the block + bullet system to be \( 1.00 \, \text{m/s} \), given the mass ratio, the bullet must have an initial speed \( v_b = 101 \, \text{m/s} \).

---

### Step 6: Is the statement ""final speed is 1.00 m/s"" true?

- **Depends on the initial speed of the bullet!**
- Without knowing \( v_b \), we cannot say the final speed is 1.00 m/s.
- If the bullet’s initial speed is 101 m/s, then yes, the final speed is 1.00 m/s.
- If the bullet speed is different, then the final speed will differ accordingly.

---

### **Final conclusion:**

The final speed of 1.00 m/s **is not guaranteed** just because the bullet embeds in the block. The final speed depends on the initial velocity of the bullet. Given no information about the bullet's initial velocity, we **cannot** say that the final speed is 1.00 m/s.

---

If you have the bullet initial velocity, then you can calculate \( v_f \) using:

\[
v_f = \frac{m_b v_b}{m_b + m_{\text{block}}}
\]

So the answer is:

**No, the final speed is not necessarily 1.00 m/s. It depends on the bullet's initial speed.**",Yes
verify,F,Does using separate chaining and resizing in a hash table guarantee constant-time search in the worst case?,"Let's analyze the question carefully and step-by-step.

**Question:** Does using separate chaining and resizing in a hash table guarantee constant-time search in the worst case?

---

### Step 1: Understand the terms and context

- **Separate chaining:**  
  This collision resolution method uses a linked list (or another data structure like a balanced tree) at each slot of the hash table to store all the keys that hash to that slot.

- **Resizing:**  
  When the hash table becomes too full (load factor exceeds some threshold), the table is resized (usually doubled in size) and all entries are rehashed to reduce collisions.

- **Constant-time search:**  
  A search operation in a hash table is considered **constant time** (O(1)) if it does not depend on the number of elements stored.

- **Worst-case:**  
  The worst-case time is the maximum time it could take for a search operation over all possible inputs (or distributions of keys).

---

### Step 2: What does separate chaining + resizing imply?

- With separate chaining, collisions are resolved by storing multiple elements at the same slot.
- With resizing, whenever the load factor gets too large, the table grows to reduce the number of elements per chain.
- Under **average case** assumptions (with a good hash function), the length of each chain is roughly the load factor = (number of elements) / (number of slots).
- Resizing ensures this load factor remains bounded by a constant (typically less than 1 or a small constant).

This means:
- **Average search time is constant:** Because the chains are short on average.

---

### Step 3: What about the worst case?

In the worst case:

- Hash functions can be poor or adversarial, causing **all elements to hash to the same slot**.
- In this extreme case, the entire dataset is stored in one chain.
- The search time then becomes **linear** in the number of elements **n** because you have to scan through a long list.

Even with resizing:

- Resizing changes the number of buckets, but doesn't prevent all elements from hashing to the same bucket — the worst-case structure does not change.
- Resizing based on load factor helps average-case performance but does **not** guarantee worst-case constant time.

---

### Step 4: Are there additional techniques to guarantee worst-case constant time?

- Use **perfect hashing** or **cuckoo hashing**, which carefully control the data structure to guarantee worst-case O(1).
- Separate chaining with resizing and a general hash function **does not guarantee** worst-case constant time.

---

### **Final Conclusion:**

- **No, using separate chaining and resizing in a hash table does NOT guarantee constant-time search in the worst case.**
- It guarantees average-case constant time (with a good hash function), but the worst-case search time can still be linear in the number of elements.

---

# **Final Answer:**

No, using separate chaining and resizing does **not** guarantee constant-time search in the worst case because in the worst case all keys can collide into a single chain, resulting in linear time complexity despite resizing.",No
